   - Sets the `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` environment variable to ensure that Python prints to stdout without buffering.

6. **Command Execution:** 
   - Specifies the command to run the model training script (`train_model.py`) when the container is started.

### Instructions for Optimization:
- **Dependency Optimization:** 
  - Remove unnecessary packages from `requirements.txt` to keep the container size minimal.
- **Container Startup Time:** 
  - Minimize dependencies and use efficient libraries to reduce the model startup time in the container.
- **Resource Allocation:** 
  - Configure Docker resources (CPU and memory limits) based on the model's resource requirements to optimize performance.

By following this Dockerfile setup and incorporating optimizations for performance and scalability, you can ensure that your machine learning model for recommending personalized learning materials runs efficiently and effectively in a production environment.
