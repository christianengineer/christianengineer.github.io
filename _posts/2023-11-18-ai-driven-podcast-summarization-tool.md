Explanation:

- The `app` directory contains the main application logic.
- The `audio`, `summary`, and `user` directories handle the respective functionalities of managing audio files, generating summaries, and user management.
- Each directory has subdirectories for `controllers`, `models`, and `routes`, which encapsulate the logic for handling requests and data manipulation.
- The `utils` directory contains utility functions for handling audio and summarization operations.
- The `config` directory includes configuration files for the database, storage, caching, and server.
- The `public` directory contains static assets like CSS, JS, and image files.
- The `views` directory holds the server-side rendered views for different pages.
- The `tests` directory is for unit tests.
- The `index.js` file is the entry point of the application.

This file structure promotes modularity, scalability, and maintainability by separating concerns and organizing the codebase in a logical manner.

To provide a detailed explanation of the core logic of the AI-Driven Podcast Summarization Tool, we can create a file called `summarizationLogic.js` within the `summary` directory.

The file path would be: `app/summary/summarizationLogic.js`.

Here's an example of how the `summarizationLogic.js` file could be structured:

```javascript
// Required dependencies and modules
const summaryModel = require("../models/summary.model");
const audioModel = require("../models/audio.model");
const summarizationUtils = require("../../utils/summarizationUtils");

// Function to generate a summary for an audio file
exports.generateSummary = async (audioId) => {
  try {
    // Fetch the audio file using its ID
    const audio = await audioModel.findById(audioId);

    // Extract the transcript from the audio using a speech-to-text API
    const transcript = await summarizationUtils.extractTranscript(
      audio.fileUrl,
    );

    // Generate a summary using text summarization techniques
    const summary = summarizationUtils.generateSummary(transcript);

    // Create a summary document and save it to the database
    const newSummary = new summaryModel({
      audio: audioId,
      transcript,
      summary,
    });
    await newSummary.save();

    // Return the generated summary
    return summary;
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error("Unable to generate the audio summary.");
  }
};
```

This file demonstrates the core logic for generating a summary for an audio file. It imports the necessary dependencies, such as the `summaryModel` and `audioModel`, which handle the database operations. It also imports `summarizationUtils`, a module that contains utility functions for extracting transcripts and generating summaries.

The `generateSummary` function takes an `audioId` as a parameter. It fetches the audio file from the database, extracts the transcript using a speech-to-text API, generates a summary using text summarization techniques, and then creates a new summary document. Finally, it saves the summary to the database and returns the generated summary.

Note that this is a simplified example, and there may be additional error handling or validation needed depending on the specific requirements of your AI-Driven Podcast Summarization Tool.

Let's create another file called `audioController.js` within the `audio` directory to handle the core logic related to audio management. This file will integrate with other files such as the `audioModel.js`, `audio.routes.js`, and `storage.js` configuration file.

The file path would be: `app/audio/controllers/audioController.js`.

Here's an example of how the `audioController.js` file could be structured:

```javascript
// Required dependencies and modules
const audioModel = require("../models/audio.model");
const storageConfig = require("../../config/storage");

// Function to upload an audio file
exports.uploadAudio = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Check if an audio file is included in the request
    if (!req.file) {
      return res.status(400).json({ message: "No audio file found." });
    }

    // Save the audio file to the configured storage (e.g., Amazon S3)
    const fileUrl = await storageConfig.uploadFile(req.file);

    // Create an audio document and save it to the database
    const newAudio = new audioModel({ fileUrl });
    await newAudio.save();

    // Return the audio document
    res.status(200).json(newAudio);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: "Error uploading audio file." });
  }
};

// Function to get audio details by ID
exports.getAudioById = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Fetch the audio file using its ID
    const audio = await audioModel.findById(req.params.id);

    // Return the audio details
    res.status(200).json(audio);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: "Error retrieving audio." });
  }
};
```

In this example, the `audioController.js` file handles two main functionalities: uploading an audio file and retrieving audio details by ID.

The `uploadAudio` function is responsible for receiving a file in the request and saving it to the configured storage, such as Amazon S3, using the `uploadFile` function from the `storage.js` configuration file. It then creates a new audio document using the `audioModel` and saves it to the database. Finally, it returns the created audio document in the response.

The `getAudioById` function retrieves audio details by ID from the database using the `audioModel`. It receives the audio ID through the request parameters and responds with the audio details.

These functions can be used as route handlers in the `audio.routes.js` file, where appropriate route paths can be defined to trigger these functions.

By separating the audio-related logic into the `audioController.js` file, we ensure a modular and organized structure within the AI-Driven Podcast Summarization Tool.

Certainly! Let's create another file called `userController.js` within the `user` directory to handle the core logic related to user management. This file will integrate with other files, such as the `userModel.js`, `user.routes.js`, and `authUtils.js` files.

The file path would be: `app/user/controllers/userController.js`.

Here's an example of how the `userController.js` file could be structured:

```javascript
// Required dependencies and modules
const userModel = require("../models/user.model");
const authUtils = require("../../utils/authUtils");

// Function to register a new user
exports.registerUser = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { username, email, password } = req.body;

    // Check if the email is already registered
    const existingUser = await userModel.findOne({ email });
    if (existingUser) {
      return res.status(400).json({ message: "Email already registered." });
    }

    // Create a new user document and save it to the database
    const newUser = new userModel({ username, email });
    newUser.passwordHash = authUtils.hashPassword(password);
    await newUser.save();

    // Return the newly registered user
    res.status(201).json(newUser);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: "Error registering user." });
  }
};

// Function to log in a user
exports.loginUser = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { email, password } = req.body;

    // Find the user by email
    const user = await userModel.findOne({ email });
    if (!user) {
      return res.status(401).json({ message: "Invalid email or password." });
    }

    // Check if the password is correct
    if (!authUtils.comparePassword(password, user.passwordHash)) {
      return res.status(401).json({ message: "Invalid email or password." });
    }

    // Generate an authentication token
    const token = authUtils.generateToken(user);

    // Return the authentication token and user details
    res.status(200).json({ token, user });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: "Error logging in user." });
  }
};
```

In this example, the `userController.js` file handles two main functionalities: registering a new user and logging in a user.

The `registerUser` function receives the user's username, email, and password in the request body. It checks if the email is already registered in the database using the `userModel`. If the email already exists, it returns an error response. Otherwise, it creates a new user document, hashes the password using the `authUtils.hashPassword` function, and saves the document to the database. Finally, it returns the newly registered user in the response.

The `loginUser` function receives the user's email and password in the request body. It finds the user by email in the database using the `userModel`. If the user does not exist or the password is incorrect, it returns an error response. Otherwise, it generates an authentication token using the `authUtils.generateToken` function and returns the token and user details in the response.

These functions can be used as route handlers in the `user.routes.js` file, where appropriate route paths can be defined to trigger these functions.

By separating the user-related logic into the `userController.js` file, we maintain a modular and organized structure within the AI-Driven Podcast Summarization Tool, focusing on user management functionalities.
