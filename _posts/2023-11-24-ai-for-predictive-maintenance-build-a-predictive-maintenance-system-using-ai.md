# Deployment Directory for AI for Predictive Maintenance

In the AI for Predictive Maintenance repository, the `deployment/` directory encompasses scripts and configurations related to the deployment of the application. This directory is essential for managing the deployment process, including setting up infrastructure, configuring environments, and automating deployment workflows. Let's explore the files within the `deployment/` directory:

## Deployment Scripts (deploymentScripts/)

The `deploymentScripts/` subdirectory contains scripts responsible for automating the deployment process, orchestrating the infrastructure, and managing the application's lifecycle. These scripts may include:

- **setup.py**: Script for setting up the deployment environment, including installing dependencies and configuring system settings.

By organizing these deployment-related components within the `deployment/` directory, the AI for Predictive Maintenance repository ensures streamlined deployment processes, infrastructure automation, and environment configuration management. This approach supports scalability, repeatability, and consistency in deploying the predictive maintenance system using AI application.

Certainly! Below is an example of a function that implements a complex machine learning algorithm for predictive maintenance in the context of the AI for Predictive Maintenance application. The function utilizes mock data for demonstration purposes. Additionally, I'll include a file path for reference.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix

def run_predictive_maintenance_algorithm(data_file_path):
    # Load mock data from file
    df = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Perform feature engineering (assuming features are already present in the dataset)
    X = df.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
    y = df['target_variable']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize and train a Random Forest classifier
    clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    confusion_mat = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

    return accuracy, confusion_mat
```

In this function:
- The `run_predictive_maintenance_algorithm` function reads mock data from a file located at the specified `data_file_path`.
- It performs feature engineering and prepares the data for training.
- The algorithm uses a Random Forest classifier to make predictions and evaluates the model's performance using accuracy and confusion matrix metrics.

The `data_file_path` parameter represents the file path where the mock data for training the predictive maintenance algorithm is stored. When using real data, this file path would point to the actual dataset.

Note that this is a simplified example for illustrative purposes. In a real-world scenario, the implementation would likely involve more extensive feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, model validation, and handling of real sensor data from equipment.

Certainly! Below is an example of a function that implements a complex deep learning algorithm for predictive maintenance in the context of the AI for Predictive Maintenance application. The function utilizes mock data for demonstration purposes and includes a file path for reference.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

def run_deep_learning_algorithm(data_file_path):
    # Load mock data from file
    df = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Perform feature engineering, data preprocessing, and splitting into features and target
    X = df.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
    y = df['target_variable']

    # Data preprocessing: feature scaling
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X = scaler.fit_transform(X)

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Define the deep learning model architecture
    model = Sequential([
        Dense(64, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],), activation='relu'),
        Dropout(0.5),
        Dense(32, activation='relu'),
        Dropout(0.3),
        Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    # Evaluate the model
    _, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)

    return accuracy
```

In this function:
- The `run_deep_learning_algorithm` function reads mock data from a file located at the specified `data_file_path`.
- It performs feature engineering, data preprocessing, and splitting the data into features and target variable.
- The algorithm defines a deep learning model using the `Sequential` API of TensorFlow/Keras, comprising multiple layers including Dense and Dropout layers.
- The model is trained and evaluated using the training and testing data splits.

The `data_file_path` parameter represents the file path where the mock data for training the deep learning algorithm is stored. When using real data, this file path would point to the actual dataset.

Note that in a real-world scenario, the deep learning algorithm would likely involve more complex model architectures, hyperparameter tuning, and handling of real sensor data from equipment.
