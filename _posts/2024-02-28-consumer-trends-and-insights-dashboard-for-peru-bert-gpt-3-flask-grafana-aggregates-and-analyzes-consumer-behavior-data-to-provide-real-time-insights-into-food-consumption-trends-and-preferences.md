```python
## train_model.py

import pandas as pd
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader

## Load and preprocess mock consumer behavior data
data_path = 'data/mock_consumer_data.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

## Preprocessing steps (tokenization, data cleaning, feature engineering, etc.)

## Define BERT model and tokenizer
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

## Define custom dataset class
class ConsumerDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data, tokenizer, max_length=128):
        self.data = data
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer
        self.max_length = max_length

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        text = self.data.loc[idx, 'text']
        label = self.data.loc[idx, 'label']

        encoding = self.tokenizer(text, truncation=True, padding='max_length', max_length=self.max_length, return_tensors='pt')
        
        return {
            'input_ids': encoding['input_ids'].flatten(),
            'attention_mask': encoding['attention_mask'].flatten(),
            'labels': torch.tensor(label, dtype=torch.long)
        }

## Prepare data and dataloader
dataset = ConsumerDataset(data, tokenizer)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

## Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-5)

## Training loop

    model.train()
    for batch in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        input_ids, attention_mask, labels = batch['input_ids'], batch['attention_mask'], batch['labels']
        outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask, labels=labels)
        loss = outputs.loss
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

## Save trained model
model_path = 'models/trained_bert_model.pth'
torch.save(model.state_dict(), model_path)
```

### File Path: `train_model.py`

This Python script loads mock consumer behavior data, preprocesses it, uses a BERT model for sentiment classification, trains the model on the mock data, and saves the trained model to a file. The trained model can then be used for sentiment analysis in the Consumer Trends and Insights Dashboard for Peru application.
