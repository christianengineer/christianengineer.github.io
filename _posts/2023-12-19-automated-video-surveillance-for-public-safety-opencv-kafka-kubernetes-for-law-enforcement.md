In the `models` directory for the Automated Video Surveillance for Public Safety application, the following files and subdirectories are included:

### Model Files

1. **object_detection_model.pb**: This file contains the trained object detection model, which has been serialized and saved in the protobuf format, commonly used for TensorFlow models. It will be deployed for detecting and localizing objects within surveillance video frames.

2. **facial_recognition_model.h5**: This file contains the trained facial recognition model, saved in the Hierarchical Data Format version 5 (HDF5) format, often used for storing large numerical datasets. The model will be utilized for recognizing and identifying faces captured in surveillance video frames.

```

In the `deployment` directory for the Automated Video Surveillance for Public Safety application, the following files are included, focused on deployment within a Kubernetes environment:

### Kubernetes Deployment Files

1. **object_detection_service.yaml**: This YAML file defines the Kubernetes Service and Deployment configurations for the object detection module of the surveillance application. It specifies the container, ports, scaling settings, and other relevant metadata required for deploying and managing the object detection service within the Kubernetes cluster.

2. **kafka_consumer.yaml**: This YAML file contains the Kubernetes configuration for deploying a Kafka consumer component that is responsible for consuming and processing the video streams received from surveillance cameras. It includes specifications for the container, environment variables, and other necessary settings for interacting with the Kafka message queue and performing real-time video analysis.

The contents of the `deployment` directory are essential for orchestrating the deployment and scaling of critical components within a Kubernetes infrastructure, ensuring the seamless operation of the video surveillance application in a scalable, containerized environment.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python file for training an object detection model for the Automated Video Surveillance for Public Safety application using mock data. This file is named `train_object_detection_model.py` and it is located in the `models` directory of the project.

```python
## File: models/object_detection/train_object_detection_model.py

import os
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

## Mock data and labels (replace with actual data and labels)
mock_training_data = np.random.rand(100, 224, 224, 3)
mock_training_labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(100,))

## Define and compile the object detection model (replace with actual model architecture)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(224, 224, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
model.fit(mock_training_data, mock_training_labels, epochs=10)

## Save the trained model
os.makedirs('models/trained_models/object_detection', exist_ok=True)
model.save('models/trained_models/object_detection/mock_object_detection_model')
```

In this example, we are using mock data and labels for training purposes. The model architecture and training process are simplified for illustration purposes. In a real-world scenario, actual training data, labels, and a more complex model architecture would be used.

The file is located at `models/object_detection/train_object_detection_model.py` within the project's directory structure. It serves as a starting point for training and saving the object detection model, enabling further enhancement and integration with the Automated Video Surveillance for Public Safety application.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python file for a complex machine learning algorithm, focusing on anomaly detection for the Automated Video Surveillance for Public Safety application using mock data. This file is named `complex_anomaly_detection_algorithm.py` and it is located in the `models` directory of the project.

```python
## File: models/complex_anomaly_detection_algorithm.py

import os
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

## Mock data for anomaly detection (replace with actual data)
mock_training_data = np.random.randn(100, 20)  ## Example of 100 samples with 20 features

## Instantiate and fit the anomaly detection model
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1)  ## Adjust parameters based on real data characteristics
model.fit(mock_training_data)

## Evaluate the model (not typically done with real-time anomaly detection)
mock_test_data = np.random.randn(20, 20)  ## Example of 20 samples with 20 features for testing
anomaly_scores = model.score_samples(mock_test_data)

## Perform post-processing and actions based on anomaly scores (e.g., raise alerts, trigger actions)
detected_anomalies = np.where(anomaly_scores < model.threshold_)[0]
if len(detected_anomalies) > 0:
    print(f"Detected {len(detected_anomalies)} anomalies: {detected_anomalies}")

## Save the trained model
os.makedirs('models/trained_models/anomaly_detection', exist_ok=True)
filename = 'models/trained_models/anomaly_detection/mock_anomaly_detection_model.pkl'
model.save(filename)
```

In this example, a complex anomaly detection algorithm using the Isolation Forest method is employed for detecting anomalies in the surveillance data. The mock data for training and testing purposes is generated, and the trained model is saved for future deployment.

The file is located at `models/complex_anomaly_detection_algorithm.py` within the project's directory structure. This example provides a foundation for integrating more sophisticated anomaly detection algorithms and handling real-time surveillance data within the Automated Video Surveillance for Public Safety application.
