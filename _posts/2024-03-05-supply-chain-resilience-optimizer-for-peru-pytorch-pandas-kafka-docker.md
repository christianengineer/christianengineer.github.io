Sure, here is an example of production-ready code for data preprocessing using Python and Pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

## Load the raw data
raw_data_path = 'path/to/raw/data.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(raw_data_path)

## Handle missing data
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
data_filled = pd.DataFrame(imputer.fit_transform(data), columns=data.columns)

## Perform standard scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
data_scaled = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(data_filled), columns=data.columns)

## Feature engineering (example: creating lagged features)
data_scaled['lagged_sales_data_3_days'] = data_scaled['historical_sales'].shift(3)

## Save the preprocessed data
preprocessed_data_path = 'path/to/preprocessed/data.csv'
data_scaled.to_csv(preprocessed_data_path, index=False)

print("Data preprocessing completed and saved.")
```

In this code snippet:

1. Data is loaded from a CSV file.
2. Missing values are imputed using the mean strategy.
3. Data is standardized using StandardScaler.
4. Feature engineering is performed by creating a lagged feature.
5. The preprocessed data is saved to a new CSV file.

To generate a large fictitious dataset that mimics real-world data relevant to the Supply Chain Resilience Optimizer project in Peru, we can utilize Python along with NumPy and Pandas for dataset creation, Faker library for generating fake data, and Scikit-learn for introducing variability. Here is a Python script that creates a synthetic dataset with relevant features for our project:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from faker import Faker
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

## Set random seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)

## Generate fake data using Faker library
fake = Faker()
num_samples = 10000

data = {
    'inventory_levels': [np.random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(num_samples)],
    'lead_times': [np.random.randint(1, 10) for _ in range(num_samples)],
    'supplier_performance': [np.random.uniform(0, 1) for _ in range(num_samples)],
    'transportation_costs': [np.random.uniform(50, 200) for _ in range(num_samples)],
    'weather_conditions': [fake.random_element(elements=('Sunny', 'Rainy', 'Cloudy')) for _ in range(num_samples)],
    'market_demand': [np.random.randint(100, 1000) for _ in range(num_samples)],
    'historical_sales': [np.random.randint(500, 2000) for _ in range(num_samples)]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

## Introduce variability using Scikit-learn make_regression
X, _ = make_regression(n_samples=num_samples, n_features=3, n_informative=3, noise=10, random_state=42)
df[['additional_feature1', 'additional_feature2', 'additional_feature3']] = X

## Save the synthetic dataset to a CSV file
df.to_csv('synthetic_dataset.csv', index=False)

print("Synthetic dataset generated successfully.")
```

In this script:
