### AWS Services:
1. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):** To store historical market data, model checkpoints, and other static assets.
2. **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** For hosting the backend server and handling real-time data processing and model inference.
3. **AWS Lambda:** For serverless computation to handle specific tasks such as data preprocessing or triggering model inference.
4. **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams:** For real-time data streaming and processing.

### GCP Services:
1. **Google Cloud Storage:** To store data, models, and other assets, similar to Amazon S3.
2. **Google Compute Engine:** For hosting the backend server and performing real-time processing tasks.
3. **Google Cloud Functions:** For serverless event-driven functions, which can be used for specific tasks or integrations.
4. **Google Cloud Pub/Sub:** For real-time messaging and data streaming.

## Docker and Kubernetes
We will containerize our backend applications using Docker and manage them in a Kubernetes cluster. This approach will provide scalability, fault tolerance, and easier deployment and management of our application components.

## Data Storage
For real-time and historical market data storage, we will utilize a scalable and reliable data storage solution such as Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) or Google Cloud SQL for structured data, and Amazon DynamoDB or Google Cloud Bigtable for NoSQL data. Additionally, the use of Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery could be considered for analytics and reporting purposes.

## Security Measures
To ensure the security of our application, we will implement best practices for cloud security, such as identity and access management (IAM), encryption of data at rest and in transit, and regular security audits and monitoring.

## Monitoring and Logging
We will incorporate monitoring and logging solutions such as AWS CloudWatch or GCP Stackdriver to track system performance, identify issues, and maintain operational visibility.

By designing our infrastructure using these components and services, we aim to create a resilient, scalable, and efficient system capable of handling the demands of real-time data processing and machine learning model inference for automated trading.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def complex_machine_learning_algorithm(data_path):
    # Load mock data from file path
    data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

    # Preprocessing: Assume the data is preprocessed and features are already prepared

    # Split data into features and target variable
    X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = data['target']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize the complex machine learning model
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)

    return model, accuracy
```

In this example, the function `complex_machine_learning_algorithm` takes a file path `data_path` as input, assuming it points to a CSV file containing the mock data. The function then performs the following steps:

1. Loads the mock data from the provided file path.
2. Splits the data into features and the target variable.
3. Splits the data into training and testing sets.
4. Initializes a complex machine learning model, in this case, a Random Forest Classifier.
5. Trains the model on the training data.
6. Makes predictions on the testing data.
7. Evaluates the model's performance by calculating the accuracy score.

Note that the data preprocessing step is assumed to be already performed for the sake of brevity in this example. The function returns the trained model and the accuracy score as the result.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

def complex_deep_learning_algorithm(data_path):
    # Load mock data from file path
    data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

    # Preprocessing: Assume the data is preprocessed and features are already prepared
    X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = data['target']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Standardize the feature data
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

    # Initialize the deep learning model
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    return model
```

In this example, the function `complex_deep_learning_algorithm` takes a file path `data_path` as input, assuming it points to a CSV file containing the mock data. The function then performs the following steps:

1. Loads the mock data from the provided file path.
2. Splits the data into features and the target variable.
3. Splits the data into training and testing sets.
4. Standardizes the feature data using `StandardScaler`.
5. Initializes a deep learning model using TensorFlow's Keras API with a simple architecture.
6. Compiles the model using an Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.
7. Trains the model on the training data for a specified number of epochs and batch size.

The function returns the trained deep learning model as the result.
