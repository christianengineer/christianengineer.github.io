File: `src/components/dashboard/DataVisualization.js`

```javascript
// File Path: src/components/dashboard/DataVisualization.js

import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { fetchSimulationData } from "../../services/api";
import { processSimulationData } from "../../utils/dataProcessor";
import BarChart from "../common/BarChart";

const DataVisualization = () => {
  const [simulationData, setSimulationData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchSimulationData()
      .then((data) => {
        const processedData = processSimulationData(data);
        setSimulationData(processedData);
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error("Error fetching simulation data:", error);
      });
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
      {simulationData.length > 0 ? (
        <BarChart data={simulationData} />
      ) : (
        <p>Loading data...</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default DataVisualization;
```

Explanation:

The `DataVisualization.js` file resides under the `src/components/dashboard/` directory. This module is responsible for visualizing the simulation data on the dashboard.

- `useEffect`: This React hook is used to fetch the simulation data from the server when the component mounts. The `fetchSimulationData()` function is responsible for making an API call to fetch the data.
- `useState`: This React hook is used to define the `simulationData` state variable, which holds the processed simulation data.
- `processSimulationData`: This function, imported from the `utils/dataProcessor.js` file, processes the raw simulation data obtained from the API call into a format suitable for visualization.
- `BarChart`: This component, imported from the `components/common/BarChart.js` file, renders a bar chart based on the simulation data.

The core logic of this module lies in fetching and processing simulation data to be displayed on the dashboard. Once the data is fetched, it is processed and stored in the component's state (`simulationData`). The `BarChart` component is rendered, passing the processed data as props.

This particular file focuses on the rapid development of the data visualization module by abstracting the data fetching and processing logic and utilizing reusable components.

File: `src/components/simulations/Simulation.js`

```javascript
// File Path: src/components/simulations/Simulation.js

import React, { useState } from "react";
import SimulationControls from "../common/SimulationControls";
import ScenarioSelector from "./ScenarioSelector";
import { runSimulation } from "../../services/simulationService";

const Simulation = () => {
  const [selectedScenario, setSelectedScenario] = useState(null);
  const [simulationRunning, setSimulationRunning] = useState(false);

  const handleStartSimulation = () => {
    if (!selectedScenario) {
      console.warn("No scenario selected.");
      return;
    }

    setSimulationRunning(true);

    // Start the simulation using selectedScenario as input
    runSimulation(selectedScenario)
      .then(() => {
        setSimulationRunning(false);
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error("Error running simulation:", error);
        setSimulationRunning(false);
      });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Simulation Module</h2>
      <SimulationControls
        onStartSimulation={handleStartSimulation}
        simulationRunning={simulationRunning}
      />
      <ScenarioSelector
        selectedScenario={selectedScenario}
        onSelectScenario={setSelectedScenario}
        simulationRunning={simulationRunning}
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Simulation;
```

Explanation:

The `Simulation.js` file resides under the `src/components/simulations/` directory. This module is responsible for managing and running the simulation, integrating with other modules such as the SimulationControls and ScenarioSelector components.

- `useState`: This React hook is used to define the state variables `selectedScenario` and `simulationRunning`.
- `handleStartSimulation`: This function is called when the user clicks on the "Start Simulation" button. It checks if a scenario is selected and then triggers the simulation process using the selected scenario.
- `runSimulation`: This asynchronous function, imported from the `services/simulationService.js` file, is responsible for running the simulation by passing the selected scenario as input.
- `SimulationControls`: This component, imported from the `components/common/SimulationControls.js` file, renders the controls for starting and stopping the simulation.
- `ScenarioSelector`: This component, located in the same file, renders the scenario selection dropdown and allows the user to choose a simulation scenario.

The unique logic of this secondary module revolves around managing the simulation state, starting the simulation with the selected scenario, and handling potential errors. The `SimulationControls` and `ScenarioSelector` components are integrated to provide a user-friendly interface for controlling the simulation. The `runSimulation` function acts as the bridge between this module and the simulation service, handling the simulation logic and returning the results or errors.

This file captures the essential functionality of the simulation module and its integration with other components, facilitating the development of this crucial part of the project.

File: `src/components/common/Modal.js`

```javascript
// File Path: src/components/common/Modal.js

import React from "react";

const Modal = ({ isOpen, onClose, children }) => {
  if (!isOpen) {
    return null;
  }

  const handleOverlayClick = (e) => {
    if (e.target === e.currentTarget) {
      onClose();
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="modal-overlay" onClick={handleOverlayClick}>
      <div className="modal-content">
        <button className="modal-close" onClick={onClose}>
          Close
        </button>
        {children}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Modal;
```

Explanation:

The `Modal.js` file resides under the `src/components/common/` directory. This module provides a reusable modal component that can be used throughout the application for displaying content in a modal dialog.

- `Modal`: This functional component takes three props: `isOpen` (a boolean indicating whether the modal is open), `onClose` (a callback function to close the modal), and `children` (the content to be rendered inside the modal).
- `if (!isOpen)`: If the `isOpen` prop is false, the component returns `null`, effectively hiding the modal.
- `handleOverlayClick`: This function is triggered when the user clicks on the modal overlay. If the click target is the overlay itself (not any of its children), the `onClose` callback is invoked to close the modal.
- The modal is structured within a div hierarchy, consisting of the overlay, the modal content, and a close button.
- The children prop is rendered inside the modal content element, allowing dynamic rendering of different content within the modal.

The `Modal` component is an additional module that has interdependencies with other previously outlined modules, such as the Dashboard and Simulation modules. It can be used, for example, to display charts or simulation results in a modal window within these modules. The `Modal` component enhances the user experience and provides a flexible way to present important information or actions without disrupting the main flow of the application.

By separating the modal logic and UI into a reusable component, it promotes code reusability and maintains a consistent user interface across different parts of the application that rely on modals.
