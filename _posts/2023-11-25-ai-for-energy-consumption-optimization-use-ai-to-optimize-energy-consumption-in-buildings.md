Certainly! Below is a Python function for a complex machine learning algorithm that uses mock data. This function represents a simplified example of a machine learning algorithm for energy consumption optimization and leverages the popular Scikit-learn library for demonstration purposes.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

def train_energy_consumption_model(data_path):
    # Load the mock data from the specified file path
    data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

    # Assume the data contains features and target variable (energy consumption)
    X = data.drop('energy_consumption', axis=1)
    y = data['energy_consumption']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize and train a complex machine learning algorithm (e.g., Random Forest)
    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Evaluate the model on the test set
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"Mean Squared Error on Test Set: {mse}")

    # Return the trained model for later use
    return model
```

In this function:
- The `train_energy_consumption_model` function takes a file path as input and assumes the file contains mock data for energy consumption modeling.
- It loads the mock data, splits it into features and the target variable (energy consumption), and then splits the data into training and testing sets.
- It initializes a complex machine learning algorithm, specifically a Random Forest Regressor from Scikit-learn, trains the model on the training data, and evaluates its performance using mean squared error on the test set.
- Finally, the trained model is returned for later use.

To use this function, you would replace `data_path` with the actual file path to the mock data file containing the energy consumption data. This function demonstrates the process of training a complex machine learning algorithm for energy consumption optimization using mock data.

    scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))
    scaled_feature_data = scaler.fit_transform(feature_data)
    scaled_target_data = scaler.fit_transform(target_data)

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(scaled_feature_data, scaled_target_data, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Reshape the input data for LSTM model (samples, time steps, features)
    X_train = X_train.reshape((X_train.shape[0], 1, X_train.shape[1]))
    X_test = X_test.reshape((X_test.shape[0], 1, X_test.shape[1]))

    # Build the LSTM model
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(LSTM(50, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2])))
    model.add(Dense(1))
    model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')

    # Train the LSTM model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, verbose=1)

    # Evaluate the model on the test set
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"Mean Squared Error on Test Set: {mse}")

    # Return the trained LSTM model for later use
    return model
```

In this function:
- The `train_energy_consumption_lstm_model` function takes a file path as input and assumes the file contains mock data for energy consumption modeling.
- It loads the mock data and preprocesses it, including normalizing the data using Min-Max scaling and splitting it into training and testing sets.
- It constructs a sequential LSTM model using Keras with TensorFlow backend, compiles the model, and trains it on the training data.
- Finally, the trained LSTM model is returned for later use.

To use this function, you would replace `data_path` with the actual file path to the mock data file containing the energy consumption data. This function demonstrates the process of training a complex deep learning algorithm, specifically an LSTM model, for energy consumption optimization using mock data.
