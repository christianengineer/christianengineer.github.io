# AI-Driven Traffic Management System

## Project Description

The AI-Driven Traffic Management System repository is an ambitious and advanced project aimed at implementing an intelligent and adaptive traffic control system. This system will utilize machine learning algorithms and AI technologies to optimize the flow of traffic dynamically in real-time. It aims to improve mobility, enhance transport efficiency, increase road safety, reduce travel time, and decrease congestion levels.

This system goes beyond conventional traffic control measures and will predict and manage traffic patterns to prevent congestion before it occurs. This way, we create safe, efficient, and sustainable city transport systems.

## Project Goals

1. **Optimize Traffic Flow:** Intelligent algorithms will be used to optimize traffic signals according to real-time traffic conditions to minimize stationary times and keep traffic flowing efficiently.

2. **Reduce Congestion:** By using predictive analytics and real-time data, we can anticipate and manage traffic load through strategic control of traffic light timings, rerouting, intelligent road designs.

3. **Improve Safety:** The system will monitor road conditions, weather, and other safety factors, making necessary adjustments to ensure safety.

4. **Eco-Friendly Cities:** By reducing traffic congestion and idle times, we also intend to lower carbon emissions stemming from transportation, promoting healthier and more sustainable cities.

5. **Scalability:** The systems should be able to handle increasing traffic loads and user requests with ease.

## Libraries and Frameworks

To achieve our project goals effectively and efficiently, we will leverage several robust programming libraries and frameworks:

1. **TensorFlow/PyTorch for Machine Learning Models:** Machine learning algorithms will be trained using TensorFlow or PyTorch, depending on the specific requirements of each model.

2. **OpenCV for Traffic Video Analysis:** OpenCV will be used for real-time video analysis of traffic conditions.

3. **OpenAI for Sustainable Traffic Policies:** We will use OpenAI's reinforcement learning algorithms to develop sustainable traffic policies based upon real-time feeds and predictive models.

4. **Numpy, Pandas, and Dask for Data Handling:** We will use Numpy and Pandas for handling, analyzing, and visualizing data related to traffic.

5. **Docker and Kubernetes for Scalability:** Docker will be used for containerization of deployment, and Kubernetes will be used for orchestration of these containers to cope with increasing user traffic without performance drops.

6. **Express.js for server-side scripting & React.js for client-side structuring and rendering:** Both libraries will help us in creating an efficient, reliable, and scalable web application that can cater to substantial user traffic and keep it running smoothly.

7. **PostgreSQL for Database Management:** PostgreSQL will effectively manage our extensive traffic data and user information.

Tagging all these with a robust testing suite like Jest for JavaScript and PyTest for Python, we would ensure a robust, maintainable and scalable system.

## Folder Structure Details:

1. **frontend:** Contains all the frontend code written in React.js. The 'src' folder contains all the reusable components, services, and assets like images.

2. **backend:** Contains all the backend code written in Express.js. The 'src' folder contains the models(database schemas), controllers(logic), routes(api endpoints), and services(core business logic).

3. **ml:** Includes all code related to machine learning models and their training, used by the backend.

4. **db:** Consists of all database-related scripts and files, including migrations.

5. **deployment:** Contains the docker and Kubernetes yml files that manage the application's containerized version and its deployment.

6. **docs:** Contains the documentation of the entire application like the system design, flow diagrams, or API documentation.

7. **.gitignore:** This text file instructs Git about which files or folders it should ignore.

8. **README.md:** It is a very crucial file that explains everything about your project – from why you built it to how to use and contribute to it.

9. **package.json:** This file is all about what scripts your application relies on, and it handles versions and scripts.

10. **Dockerfile:** This plain text file contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to create a docker image.

11. **docker-compose.yml:** This YAML file is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

# File Location:

The AI logic File is located under the `ml` directory. In the `ml` directory, you can find the module responsible for handling the logic related to the AI processing of the traffic management system. Let's call this file `trafficAI.py`.

# File Code (trafficAI.py):

```python

import cv2
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

class AITrafficManagement:

    DEFAULT_MODEL_PATH = './models/traffic_model'

    def __init__(self, model_path=DEFAULT_MODEL_PATH):
        self.model = keras.models.load_model(model_path)

    def predict_traffic_flow(self, image):
        processed_image = self.preprocess_image(image)
        prediction = self.model.predict(processed_image)
        return prediction

    def preprocess_image(self, image):
        # convert image to grayscale
        gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
        # normalize the image pixel values
        normalized = gray / 255.0
        # reshape image to fit the model's input shape
        reshaped = np.reshape(normalized, (1, normalized.shape[0], normalized.shape[1], 1))
        return reshaped

    # the method below is used to train the model and update its weights periodically
    def train_model(self, data, labels):
        # split data and labels into training and testing sets
        train_data, test_data, train_labels, test_labels = train_test_split(data, labels)
        # compile the model
        self.model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
        # fit the model to the training data
        self.model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=10)
        # evaluate the model using the test data
        test_loss, test_acc = self.model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels, verbose=2)
        print('\nTest accuracy:', test_acc)
        # save the trained model
        self.model.save(self.DEFAULT_MODEL_PATH)

```

In this fictitious `trafficAI.py` file, the `AITrafficManagement` class includes the logic needed for AI-driven traffic management. _Note: In reality, this is a highly simplified example that doesn't fully cover all the complexities of traffic prediction._ Each function is designed with a specific role, including preprocessing of traffic images, prediction of traffic flow, and training of the AI model.
