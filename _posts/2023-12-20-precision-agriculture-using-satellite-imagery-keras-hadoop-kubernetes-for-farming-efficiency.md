#### System Design Strategies
The system design will incorporate the following strategies:
- Data pipeline: Implement a robust data pipeline for ingesting, cleaning, and processing the satellite imagery data using Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and related technologies such as Apache Spark for distributed processing.
- Machine learning models: Utilize Keras, a high-level neural networks API, to build and train deep learning models for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and regression for yield prediction.
- Scalability and reliability: Employ Kubernetes to orchestrate containers for deploying and managing the machine learning models, ensuring scalability, fault tolerance, and self-healing capabilities.
- Real-time analysis: Incorporate streaming data processing to enable real-time analysis of satellite imagery data, allowing for timely decision-making in precision agriculture practices.

#### Chosen Libraries and Frameworks
The selected libraries and frameworks for the project are as follows:
- Keras: For building and training deep learning models in a user-friendly and high-level interface, enabling rapid prototyping and experimentation with different neural network architectures.
- Hadoop: For distributed storage and processing of large-scale satellite imagery data, providing fault tolerance and high throughput for data-intensive workloads.

### MLOps Infrastructure for Precision Agriculture using Satellite Imagery

To establish a robust MLOps infrastructure for the Precision Agriculture using Satellite Imagery application, we will integrate the following components and best practices:

#### Version Control System (VCS)
Utilize a version control system such as Git to manage the codebase, model scripts, and configuration files. This will enable collaboration, code reviews, and reproducibility of experiments.

#### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate the testing, building, and deployment of machine learning models and related infrastructure components. This will ensure rapid iteration and deployment of new models and features.

#### Model Training and Serving
Utilize Keras for building and training machine learning models, with a focus on creating reproducible and versioned experiments. After the models are trained, they will be deployed in Kubernetes clusters for serving predictions.

#### Model Monitoring and Observability
Integrate monitoring tools to track model performance, data drift, and system health. Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to gain insights into the behavior of the deployed models and Kubernetes clusters.

#### Data Management
Leverage Hadoop for storing and managing large-scale satellite imagery data in a distributed and fault-tolerant manner. Implement data versioning and lineage tracking to ensure traceability and reproducibility.

#### Logging and Auditing
Centralize logging and auditing of model predictions, data transformations, and system events. Tools like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) can be used to aggregate and visualize logs and provide insights into system behavior.

#### Model Governance and Compliance
Establish processes for model governance and compliance, including model versioning, model approval workflows, and documentation of model performance and behavior.

#### Infrastructure as Code
Adopt infrastructure as code practices using tools like Terraform or Kubernetes manifests to define the deployment and configuration of the AI infrastructure, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across different environments.

#### Security and Access Control
Implement security best practices to protect the AI infrastructure and data, including role-based access control, encryption at rest and in transit, and regular security audits.

By incorporating these MLOps practices and infrastructure components, the Precision Agriculture using Satellite Imagery application aims to establish a systematic and efficient workflow for deploying, monitoring, and managing machine learning models at scale in a complex AI environment.

This script assumes a simplified scenario for demonstration purposes, and the actual implementation would involve real satellite imagery data preprocessing and feature engineering.

```python
## File: models/training_scripts/train_crop_classifier.py

import numpy as np
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

## Generate mock data (replace with real data loading and preprocessing)
def generate_mock_data():
    ## Mock satellite imagery data and labels
    num_samples = 1000
    img_height = 64
    img_width = 64
    num_channels = 3

    X = np.random.rand(num_samples, img_height, img_width, num_channels)  ## Mock satellite imagery data
    y = np.random.randint(0, 5, num_samples)  ## Mock crop class labels (e.g., 5 crop classes)

    return X, y

## Define the crop classification model architecture
def create_crop_classifier_model(input_shape, num_classes):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
    model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
    model.add(Flatten())
    model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))

    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    return model

## Main function for training the crop classification model
def train_crop_classifier():
    ## Generate mock data
    X, y = generate_mock_data()

    input_shape = X.shape[1:]  ## Input shape for the model
    num_classes = len(np.unique(y))  ## Number of unique crop classes

    ## Create and compile the crop classifier model
    crop_classifier_model = create_crop_classifier_model(input_shape, num_classes)

    ## Train the model
    crop_classifier_model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
