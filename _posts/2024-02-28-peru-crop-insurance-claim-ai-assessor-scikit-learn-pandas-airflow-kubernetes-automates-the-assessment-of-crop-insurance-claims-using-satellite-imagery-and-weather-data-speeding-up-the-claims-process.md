Below is a sample file `train_model.py` for training a machine learning model for the Peru Crop Insurance Claim AI Assessor using mock data. This script utilizes Scikit-Learn for model training and Pandas for data manipulation.

### File: `train_model.py`
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
import joblib

## File path to mock data
data_path = 'data/processed_data/mock_data.csv'

## Load mock data
data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

## Separate features and target variable
X = data.drop('claim_status', axis=1)
y = data['claim_status']

## Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Initialize and train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

## Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

## Save the trained model
model_path = 'models/model_1/model.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, model_path)

## Print evaluation results
print(f'Model trained and saved successfully.\nAccuracy: {accuracy}\nClassification Report:\n{report}')
```

### Explanation:
- This script loads mock data from the file path `data/processed_data/mock_data.csv`.
- It then prepares the data by separating features and the target variable ('claim_status') and splitting it into training and testing sets.
- A RandomForestClassifier model is trained on the training data and used to make predictions on the test set.
- The script evaluates the model's performance by calculating accuracy and generating a classification report.
- The trained model is saved to the file path `models/model_1/model.pkl`.
- Finally, it prints out the evaluation results.

You can run this script to train the model using mock data and save the model for later use in the AI Peru Crop Insurance Claim AI Assessor application.

joblib.dump(model, model_path)

## Print evaluation results
print(f'Complex model trained and saved successfully.\nAccuracy: {accuracy}\nClassification Report:\n{report}')
```

### Explanation:
- This script loads mock data from the file path `data/processed_data/mock_data.csv`.
