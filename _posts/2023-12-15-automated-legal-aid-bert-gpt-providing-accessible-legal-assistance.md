Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a BERT model for the Automated Legal Aid application using mock data. This script assumes the availability of the BERT model-specific fine-tuning scripts, which are typically provided by the Hugging Face Transformers library. The script uses the PyTorch framework for training the BERT model.

```python
# File: models/bert/fine_tuning_scripts/train_bert_model.py
import torch
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification, AdamW
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, DataLoader, RandomSampler, SequentialSampler
from transformers import get_linear_schedule_with_warmup
import numpy as np

# Mock data (replace with actual data loading and preprocessing)
input_texts = ["Sample legal text 1", "Sample legal text 2", "Sample legal text 3"]
labels = [1, 0, 1]  # Example binary labels

# BERT-specific setup
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
encoded_texts = tokenizer(input_texts, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')
input_ids = encoded_texts['input_ids']
attention_masks = encoded_texts['attention_mask']
labels = torch.tensor(labels)

# Create TensorDataset for training
dataset = TensorDataset(input_ids, attention_masks, labels)

# Define model
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased", num_labels=2)
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)

# Define data loader
batch_size = 32
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, sampler=RandomSampler(dataset), batch_size=batch_size)

# Define optimizer and learning rate scheduler
optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=2e-5, eps=1e-8)
epochs = 3
total_steps = len(dataloader) * epochs
scheduler = get_linear_schedule_with_warmup(optimizer, num_warmup_steps=0, num_training_steps=total_steps)

# Model training
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        b_input_ids, b_input_mask, b_labels = batch
        b_input_ids = b_input_ids.to(device)
        b_input_mask = b_input_mask.to(device)
        b_labels = b_labels.to(device)
        model.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(b_input_ids, token_type_ids=None, attention_mask=b_input_mask, labels=b_labels)
        loss = outputs.loss
        loss.backward()
        torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), 1.0)
        optimizer.step()
        scheduler.step()

# Save trained model
output_model_file = "models/bert/trained_model/pytorch_model.bin"
model_to_save = model.module if hasattr(model, 'module') else model
torch.save(model_to_save.state_dict(), output_model_file)
```

In this example, the script trains a BERT model for a binary classification task using provided mock data. The file path for this script is `models/bert/fine_tuning_scripts/train_bert_model.py` within the repository structure.

Please note that in a real-world scenario, it's important to use an appropriate dataset, perform data preprocessing, fine-tune the model with real legal data, and carefully handle model checkpoints and saving.

Certainly! Here's an example of a script for a complex machine learning algorithm using a combination of BERT and GPT models for the Automated Legal Aid application. This script demonstrates how both BERT and GPT models can be leveraged in a sequential manner for a hypothetical legal document summarization task using mock data.

```python
# File: models/complex_legal_aid_algorithm.py
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel, GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel
import torch

# Mock data (replace with actual data loading and preprocessing)
legal_documents = [
    "This is the first legal document.",
    "Here is another legal document discussing relevant case law.",
    "The third document contains important legal arguments."
]

# BERT for document embedding
bert_tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
bert_model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# GPT-2 for document summarization
gpt_tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
gpt_model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')

# Processing the legal documents with BERT
encoded_legal_docs = [bert_tokenizer.encode(doc, add_special_tokens=True, return_tensors='pt', max_length=512, truncation=True) for doc in legal_documents]
bert_outputs = [bert_model(doc) for doc in encoded_legal_docs]

# Extracting BERT document embeddings
doc_embeddings = [output.last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1) for output in bert_outputs]

# Generating document summaries with GPT-2
summaries = []
for emb, doc in zip(doc_embeddings, legal_documents):
    input_ids = gpt_tokenizer.encode(doc, return_tensors='pt', max_length=1024, truncation=True)
    summary_ids = gpt_model.generate(input_ids, max_length=100, num_return_sequences=1, no_repeat_ngram_size=2, early_stopping=True)
    summary = gpt_tokenizer.decode(summary_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    summaries.append(summary)

# Output the generated summaries
for i, summary in enumerate(summaries):
    print(f"Summary for Document {i + 1}:\n{summary}")

# This script demonstrates a complex machine learning algorithm incorporating both BERT and GPT-2 models. The file path for this script is `models/complex_legal_aid_algorithm.py` within the repository structure.

Please note that in a real-world scenario, it's crucial to use appropriate legal data, perform thorough data preprocessing, and handle model outputs carefully to ensure high-quality and legally compliant document summarization.
