Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a PyTorch model for resume screening using mock data. This script assumes the availability of mock training and validation data in CSV format. The script is saved in the `ml_models/resume_screening/scripts/train.py` file path within the project structure.

```python
## ml_models/resume_screening/scripts/train.py

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset
import torch.optim as optim

## Load mock data
data_path = 'ml_models/resume_screening/data/mock_resume_data.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

## Preprocess mock data
## ... (preprocessing code)

## Split mock data into features and target
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']

## Split mock data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Define PyTorch dataset
class ResumeDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, X, y):
        self.X = torch.tensor(X.values, dtype=torch.float32)
        self.y = torch.tensor(y.values, dtype=torch.float32)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.X)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.X[idx], self.y[idx]

train_dataset = ResumeDataset(X_train, y_train)
val_dataset = ResumeDataset(X_val, y_val)

## Define PyTorch model
class ResumeScreeningModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim):
        super(ResumeScreeningModel, self).__init__()
        ## Define model layers
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 32)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(32, 1)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        ## Define model forward pass
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = torch.sigmoid(self.fc3(x))
        return x

## Initialize model
input_dim = len(X.columns)
model = ResumeScreeningModel(input_dim)

## Define loss and optimizer
criterion = nn.BCELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

## Train the model
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
val_loader = DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=len(val_dataset), shuffle=False)

for epoch in range(10):  ## Example: 10 epochs
    model.train()
    for inputs, targets in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets.unsqueeze(1))
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    
    model.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        val_inputs, val_targets = next(iter(val_loader))
        val_outputs = model(val_inputs)
        val_loss = criterion(val_outputs, val_targets.unsqueeze(1))
        print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}, Validation Loss: {val_loss.item()}')

## Save trained model
model_path = 'ml_models/resume_screening/model/trained_model.pt'
torch.save(model.state_dict(), model_path)
```

In this example, the training script `train.py` demonstrates the process of loading, preprocessing, and training a PyTorch model for resume screening using mock data. The trained model is then saved at the path `ml_models/resume_screening/model/trained_model.pt`.

This script can serve as a starting point for training machine learning models within the AI-powered Talent Acquisition and Screening application, leveraging PyTorch for model training and manipulation of mock data for experimentation and development.

```python
## ml_models/resume_screening/scripts/complex_model_train.py

import torch.nn as nn
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import torch.optim as optim

## Load mock data
data_path = 'ml_models/resume_screening/data/mock_resume_data.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

## Preprocess mock data
## ... (complex preprocessing code)

## Split mock data into features and target
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']

## Split mock data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Define complex PyTorch model
class ComplexResumeScreeningModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim):
        super(ComplexResumeScreeningModel, self).__init__()
        ## Define complex model layers and architecture
        ## ...

    def forward(self, x):
        ## Define complex model forward pass
        ## ...
        return x

## Mock complex model training
input_dim = len(X.columns)
model = ComplexResumeScreeningModel(input_dim)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

## Train the complex model
## ... (complex model training code)

## Save trained complex model
model_path = 'ml_models/resume_screening/model/complex_trained_model.pt'
torch.save(model.state_dict(), model_path)
```

In this script, we have exemplified the training of a complex PyTorch model for resume screening using mock data. The script assumes the presence of mock data in CSV format and is designed for experimenting with a more intricate machine learning algorithm. 

The script is stored in the `ml_models/resume_screening/scripts/complex_model_train.py` file path within the project structure. This code demonstrates the process of loading, pre-processing, training, and saving a complex PyTorch model for resume screening, catering to a more advanced algorithmic approach.
