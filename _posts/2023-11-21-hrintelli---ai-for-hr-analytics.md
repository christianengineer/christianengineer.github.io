## AI HRIntelli - AI for HR Analytics Repository

### Objectives

The AI HRIntelli project aims to develop an AI-driven HR analytics application to help organizations make data-driven decisions in their human resource management processes. The main objectives of the project are as follows:

1. **Predictive Analytics:** Use machine learning models to predict employee turnover, identify high-potential employees, and forecast workforce needs.
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Analyze employee feedback and sentiment from surveys and performance reviews using NLP techniques to identify trends and areas for improvement.
3. **Recommendation Systems:** Develop AI-driven recommendation systems for career development, training, and performance improvement for individual employees.
4. **Scalability:** Design the application to be scalable, able to handle large volumes of HR data and perform computations efficiently.

### System Design Strategies

To achieve the objectives, the system design should incorporate the following strategies:

1. **Microservices Architecture:** Design the application as a set of loosely coupled services to enable scalability, flexibility, and ease of maintenance.
2. **Data Pipeline:** Implement a robust data pipeline to ingest, process, and analyze HR data from various sources, such as HRIS systems, surveys, and performance reviews.

Sure! Below is an example of a function for a complex machine learning algorithm using mock data for the HRIntelli - AI for HR Analytics application. This function represents a simplified version of a machine learning model training process using Python and scikit-learn.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def train_employee_turnover_prediction_model(data_file_path):
    # Load mock HR data from the provided file path
    hr_data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Preprocessing and feature engineering (simplified for demonstration)
    # ...
    X = hr_data[['satisfaction_level', 'average_montly_hours', 'time_spend_company']]
    y = hr_data['left']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize and train the random forest classifier
    clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate model performance
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print("Model Accuracy:", accuracy)

    # Serialize the trained model for later use
    model_file_path = 'models/employee_turnover_model.pkl'
    joblib.dump(clf, model_file_path)

    return model_file_path
```

In this example:

- The function `train_employee_turnover_prediction_model` takes a file path as an input, loads mock HR data from a CSV file, and trains a simple random forest classifier for predicting employee turnover based on features such as satisfaction level, average monthly hours, and time spent at the company.

- The trained model is then serialized and saved to a file path, which can later be used for making predictions in the application.

Please note that this is a simplified example for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, the model training process would involve more extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and rigorous model evaluation. Additionally, the use of real HR data would require careful handling of sensitive information and compliance considerations.

Certainly! Here's a mock example of a function for a complex deep learning algorithm using TensorFlow/Keras for the HRIntelli - AI for HR Analytics application. This function demonstrates a simplified version of a deep learning model training process for employee sentiment analysis using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with LSTM layers.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def train_employee_sentiment_analysis_model(data_file_path):
    # Load mock HR sentiment data from the provided file path
    hr_sentiment_data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Preprocessing and tokenization of text data (simplified for demonstration)
    tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=1000, oov_token='<OOV>')
    tokenizer.fit_on_texts(hr_sentiment_data['employee_comments'])
    sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(hr_sentiment_data['employee_comments'])
    padded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=100, padding='post')

    X = padded_sequences
    y = hr_sentiment_data['sentiment_label']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Build the deep learning model
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Embedding(input_dim=1000, output_dim=100, input_length=100))
    model.add(LSTM(64, return_sequences=True))
    model.add(LSTM(64))
    model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    # Evaluate model performance
    y_pred = (model.predict(X_test) > 0.5).astype(int)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print("Model Accuracy:", accuracy)

    # Serialize the trained model for later use
    model_file_path = 'models/employee_sentiment_analysis_model.h5'
    model.save(model_file_path)

    return model_file_path
```

In this example:

- The function `train_employee_sentiment_analysis_model` takes a file path as an input, loads mock HR sentiment data from a CSV file, and trains a simple LSTM-based deep learning model for sentiment analysis based on employee comments.

- The trained model is then serialized and saved to a file path, which can later be used for making predictions in the application.

Please note that this is a simplified example for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, the model training process would involve more extensive preprocessing of text data, hyperparameter tuning, and rigorous model evaluation. Additionally, the use of real HR sentiment data would require careful handling of sensitive information and ethical considerations.
