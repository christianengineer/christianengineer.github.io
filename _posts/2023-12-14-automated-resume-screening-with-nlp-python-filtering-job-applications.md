## Objectives
The objective of the AI Automated Resume Screening with NLP (Python) Filtering job applications repository is to implement a scalable and efficient system for automatically screening and filtering job applications using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The system should be capable of processing large volumes of resumes, extracting relevant information, and making decisions based on predefined criteria.

## System Design Strategies
1. **Scalable Data Pipeline**: Implement a scalable data pipeline to ingest, preprocess, and store resume data efficiently. This could involve using tools like Apache Spark or Apache Flink for distributed data processing.

2. **NLP Processing**: Utilize NLP techniques to extract key information from resumes, such as skills, experience, and education. This could involve using libraries like spaCy or NLTK for text processing and feature extraction.

3. **Machine Learning Models**: Develop and train machine learning models to classify and rank resumes based on predefined criteria such as job fit, experience, and qualifications. This could involve using libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow for model development and training.

4. **Integration with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)**: Integrate the system with existing ATS to seamlessly process and filter incoming job applications and update candidate status.

5. **API and Frontend Integration**: Provide an API for interacting with the screening system and develop a frontend dashboard for visualizing and managing the screening results.

## Chosen Libraries
1. **spaCy**: For NLP processing, including tasks such as named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and entity extraction.

2. **scikit-learn**: For building and training machine learning models for classification and ranking of resumes based on predefined criteria.

3. **Flask**: For building the API to interact with the screening system and integrating the system with existing ATS.

4. **React.js**: For developing the frontend dashboard to visualize and manage the screening results.

By following these design strategies and leveraging the chosen libraries, we can build a robust and scalable AI Automated Resume Screening system that effectively filters job applications based on NLP and machine learning techniques.

## MLOps Infrastructure for Automated Resume Screening with NLP

### Version Control
Utilize a version control system like Git to track changes in the codebase and ensure collaboration among the development team.

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate the testing, building, and deployment of the application. Tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, or GitLab CI/CD can be used to ensure that changes are tested and deployed consistently.

### Model Versioning
Use a model versioning system to track and manage different iterations of the machine learning models. Tools such as MLflow or DVC can help in tracking experiments, parameters, and metrics associated with the models.

### Model Training and Serving Infrastructure
Deploy scalable infrastructure for model training and serving. This could involve using platforms like Amazon SageMaker, Google Cloud AI Platform, or building custom Dockerized environments to ensure reproducibility and scalability.

### Monitoring and Logging
Implement monitoring and logging solutions to track the performance of the application, including model metrics, data quality, and system health. Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack can be used for monitoring and logging.

### A/B Testing
Set up infrastructure for A/B testing to evaluate the performance of new model versions in production. Tools like Apache Kafka or custom in-house solutions can be used to divert traffic to different model versions and compare their performance.

### Infrastructure as Code
Utilize infrastructure as code (IaC) principles to define and manage the infrastructure required for the application using tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation, ensuring reproducibility and consistency across environments.

### Security and Compliance
Implement security measures and ensure compliance with data privacy regulations. Use tools like Vault for secret management, and enforce best practices for handling sensitive data and model outputs.

By integrating these MLOps practices into the infrastructure for the Automated Resume Screening with NLP application, we can ensure that the system is robust, maintainable, and scalable, while enabling seamless collaboration, reproducibility, and monitoring of the entire AI application.

```

In the "models" directory, we store serialized files for the trained machine learning models used in the Automated Resume Screening with NLP application. These files hold the state of the trained models, including the learned parameters, and can be used for making predictions without the need for retraining the models.

The serialized model files can be in various formats, such as .pkl (for scikit-learn models) or .h5 (for TensorFlow or Keras models), depending on the libraries and frameworks used for model development.

It's important to maintain version control of these model files and track the pertinent details of each model, such as the training data, hyperparameters, and performance metrics, to facilitate reproducibility and comparison between different model versions.

Additionally, it's crucial to establish robust processes for updating and managing these model files to ensure that the application always employs the most up-to-date and effective models in the resume screening process.

```

In the "deployment" directory, we manage the configuration files and scripts for deploying the Automated Resume Screening with NLP application.

1. **Docker**: The "docker" subdirectory contains the Dockerfile, providing instructions for building a Docker image that encapsulates the application and its dependencies. Additionally, the "requirements.txt" file specifies the specific Python dependencies required within the Docker image.

2. **Kubernetes**: Within the "kubernetes" subdirectory, we store Kubernetes manifests defining the resources needed to deploy the screening service in a Kubernetes cluster. The "screening-service.yaml" file, for instance, might define the Kubernetes Deployment, Service, and associated resources.

3. **Terraform**: The "terraform" subdirectory includes the main Terraform configuration file ("main.tf") and possibly other related files ("variables.tf"). These files define the infrastructure components and their configuration, enabling the deployment of the application on cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, or Azure.

By leveraging these files and directories within the "deployment" directory, we can ensure a structured and reproducible deployment process for the Automated Resume Screening with NLP application, minimizing deployment-related issues and maintaining consistency across different environments.

Certainly! Below is an example file for training a machine learning model for the Automated Resume Screening with NLP application using mock data. This file can be named as "train_model.py" and placed within the "src/model_training/" directory:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import joblib

## Load mock resume data (replace with actual data loading code)
mock_resume_data = pd.read_csv('path_to_mock_resume_data.csv')

## Preprocess and feature extraction (replace with actual preprocessing and feature extraction code)
text_data = mock_resume_data['text']
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(text_data)
y = mock_resume_data['label']

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Train a machine learning model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Evaluate the model
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Model accuracy: {accuracy}')

## Serialize the trained model to a file
joblib.dump(model, 'path_to_save_trained_model.pkl')
```

In this script, we load the mock resume data, preprocess it, and then train a simple Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn. The trained model is then serialized to a file using joblib.

Replace "path_to_mock_resume_data.csv" with the actual path to the mock resume data file and "path_to_save_trained_model.pkl" with the desired path to save the trained model file.

This file demonstrates a basic example of how a machine learning model can be trained for the Automated Resume Screening with NLP application using Python and scikit-learn.

Certainly! Below is an example file for training a more complex machine learning algorithm, such as a Random Forest Classifier, for the Automated Resume Screening with NLP application using mock data. This file can be named as "train_complex_model.py" and placed within the "src/model_training/" directory:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import joblib

## Load mock resume data (replace with actual data loading code)
mock_resume_data = pd.read_csv('path_to_mock_resume_data.csv')

## Preprocess and feature extraction (replace with actual preprocessing and feature extraction code)
text_data = mock_resume_data['text']
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(text_data)
y = mock_resume_data['label']

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Train a Random Forest Classifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=10, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Model accuracy: {accuracy}')

## Serialize the trained model to a file
joblib.dump(model, 'path_to_save_complex_trained_model.pkl')
```

In this script, we load the mock resume data, preprocess it with TfidfVectorizer, and then train a Random Forest Classifier using scikit-learn. The trained model is then serialized to a file using joblib.

Replace "path_to_mock_resume_data.csv" with the actual path to the mock resume data file and "path_to_save_complex_trained_model.pkl" with the desired path to save the trained model file.

This file demonstrates a more complex example of training a machine learning model using a Random Forest Classifier for the Automated Resume Screening with NLP application using Python and scikit-learn.
