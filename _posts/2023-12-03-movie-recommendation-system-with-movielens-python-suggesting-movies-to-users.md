## AI Movie Recommendation System with MovieLens

## Objectives

The objective of the AI Movie Recommendation System is to build a scalable, data-intensive application that leverages machine learning to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and behavior. This system aims to provide personalized movie recommendations to enhance user experience and engagement.

## System Design Strategies

### Data Collection and Storage

1. **Data Collection**: Use the MovieLens dataset or similar movie ratings dataset for collecting user preferences and movie information.
2. **Data Storage**: Utilize a scalable and robust database such as PostgreSQL or MongoDB to store user profiles, movie ratings, and movie metadata.

### Machine Learning Model

1. **Collaborative Filtering**: Implement collaborative filtering algorithms such as user-based or item-based collaborative filtering to generate movie recommendations based on user behavior and preferences.
2. **Model Training**: Utilize machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow to train the recommendation model on the collected movie ratings data.

### Recommendation Engine

1. **Scalable Recommendation Engine**: Design a scalable recommendation engine that can handle a large number of users and movies efficiently.
2. **Real-time Recommendation**: Implement real-time recommendation generation to provide instant feedback to the users.

### Frontend and Backend Architecture

1. **Microservices Architecture**: Consider implementing a microservices architecture to decouple the recommendation engine from the frontend application, allowing for better scalability and maintainability.
2. **RESTful APIs**: Design RESTful APIs for communication between the frontend and backend components of the system.

## Chosen Libraries and Frameworks

### Python Libraries

1. **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing of the MovieLens dataset.
2. **scikit-learn**: To build and train machine learning models for collaborative filtering.
3. **Flask**: As a lightweight web framework for building the backend API services.
4. **Celery**: For asynchronous task processing, which can be useful for background model training and recommendation generation.
5. **SQLAlchemy**: To interact with the database and manage the persistence layer for user profiles and movie data.

### Additional Technologies

1. **Docker**: For containerization and deployment of the microservices components of the system.
2. **Kubernetes**: For orchestrating and managing the containerized components in a production environment.
3. **React**: As a frontend framework for building an interactive user interface to display movie recommendations.

By employing these design strategies and leveraging the chosen libraries and frameworks, the AI Movie Recommendation System aims to deliver personalized and scalable movie recommendations to users, enhancing their overall movie-watching experience.

```python
import pandas as pd

def complex_movie_recommendation_algorithm(user_id, movie_data_path, user_ratings_path):
    ## Load movie data
    movies = pd.read_csv(movie_data_path)

    ## Load user ratings
    user_ratings = pd.read_csv(user_ratings_path)

    ## Implement complex machine learning algorithm here
    ## Example: Collaborative Filtering with Matrix Factorization
    ## (This is a simplified example for demonstration purposes)

    ## Merge user ratings with movie data
    movie_user_ratings = pd.merge(movies, user_ratings, on='movieId')

    ## Perform matrix factorization or any complex algorithm to generate recommendations
    ## Recommendation algorithm code goes here

    ## Example: Return top 10 movie recommendations for the user
    top_recommendations = movie_user_ratings.groupby('title')['rating'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)

    return top_recommendations
```

In this example, the function `complex_movie_recommendation_algorithm` takes the user ID, file path for the movie data, and file path for the user ratings as input parameters. Inside the function, it loads the movie data and user ratings from the provided file paths using pandas. Then, it applies a complex machine learning algorithm, such as collaborative filtering with matrix factorization, to generate movie recommendations for the user. For the sake of this example, it then returns the top 10 movie recommendations based on the user ratings.

When using real data, the recommendation algorithm implementation will depend on the specific machine learning techniques and models chosen for the Movie Recommendation System.

```python
import pandas as pd

def complex_movie_recommendation_algorithm(user_id, movie_data_path, user_ratings_path):
    ## Load movie data
    movies = pd.read_csv(movie_data_path)

    ## Load user ratings
    user_ratings = pd.read_csv(user_ratings_path)

    ## Implement complex machine learning algorithm here
    ## Example: Collaborative Filtering with Matrix Factorization
    ## (This is a simplified example for demonstration purposes)

    ## Merge user ratings with movie data
    movie_user_ratings = pd.merge(movies, user_ratings, on='movieId')

    ## Perform matrix factorization or any complex algorithm to generate recommendations
    ## Example: Use a machine learning model to predict movie ratings for the user
    ## (This example assumes a pre-trained model is used for demonstration)
    ## Replace this with actual model inference logic in a real-world scenario
    predicted_ratings = [4.5, 3.8, 4.0, 5.0, 2.5]  ## Example of predicted ratings for movies

    ## Map predicted ratings to movie titles
    movie_titles = movie_user_ratings['title'].unique()
    predictions = dict(zip(movie_titles, predicted_ratings))

    ## Example: Return top 10 movie recommendations based on predicted ratings
    top_recommendations = sorted(predictions, key=predictions.get, reverse=True)[:10]

    return top_recommendations
```

In this example, the `complex_movie_recommendation_algorithm` function takes the user ID, file path for the movie data, and file path for the user ratings as input parameters. Inside the function, it loads the movie data and user ratings from the provided file paths using the `Pandas` library. Then, it applies a complex machine learning algorithm, such as collaborative filtering with matrix factorization, to generate movie recommendations for the user. For the sake of this example, it uses a mock scenario and predicts movie ratings for the user using pre-defined predicted ratings. These predicted ratings are then used to generate the top 10 movie recommendations for the user.

When using real data and models, the recommendation algorithm implementation will depend on the specific machine learning techniques and models chosen for the Movie Recommendation System.
