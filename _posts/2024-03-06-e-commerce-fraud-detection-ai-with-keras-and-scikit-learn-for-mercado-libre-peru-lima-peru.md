To generate a large fictitious dataset that simulates real-world data relevant to the E-commerce Fraud Detection AI project, incorporating features for feature extraction, feature engineering, and metadata management strategies, you can use Python along with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Faker for creating synthetic data. The dataset creation script below includes features relevant to the project's objectives and leverages randomization to incorporate real-world variability:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from faker import Faker

# Initialize Faker for synthesizing fake data
fake = Faker()

# Generate synthetic data for the dataset
num_records = 10000

data = {
    'transaction_amount': np.random.uniform(10, 500, num_records),
    'transaction_frequency': np.random.poisson(5, num_records),
    'time_since_last_transaction': np.random.randint(1, 30, num_records),
    'session_duration': np.random.randint(60, 1800, num_records),
    'click_through_rate': np.random.uniform(0, 1, num_records),
    'add_to_cart_frequency': np.random.poisson(3, num_records),
    'geo_location': [fake.country_code() for _ in range(num_records)],
    'device_type': [fake.random_element(elements=('desktop', 'mobile', 'tablet')) for _ in range(num_records)],
    'ip_country': [fake.country() for _ in range(num_records)],
    'fraudulent': np.random.choice([0, 1], num_records)
}

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Introduce variability in the fraudulent flag for a realistic dataset
df.loc[df['fraudulent'] == 1, 'fraudulent'] = np.random.choice([1, 0], len(df[df['fraudulent'] == 1]), p=[0.1, 0.9])

# Save the generated dataset to a CSV file
df.to_csv('synthetic_data.csv', index=False)
