```python
# File: src/model_training/train_model.py
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from src.data_preprocessing.data_cleaning import clean_data  # Assuming data cleaning function is implemented in data_cleaning.py

# Load mock sensor data (mock data path)
mock_data_path = 'data/raw_data/mock_sensor_data.csv'
sensor_data = pd.read_csv(mock_data_path)

# Clean and preprocess the data
cleaned_data = clean_data(sensor_data)  # Assuming clean_data function handles preprocessing

# Split data into features and target
X = cleaned_data.drop('target_variable', axis=1)  # Replace 'target_variable' with the actual target variable name
y = cleaned_data['target_variable']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define a Keras sequential model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=[len(X_train.keys())]),
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['mae', 'mse'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Save the trained model
model.save('models/keras_models/trained_model.h5')
```
In this example, the `train_model.py` script loads mock sensor data, preprocesses the data, trains a Keras model, and saves the trained model in the designated directory. It assumes the availability of a data cleaning function and the necessary preprocessing steps. The mock data is assumed to be stored in a CSV file named `mock_sensor_data.csv` within the `data/raw_data/` directory. The trained model is saved as `trained_model.h5` in the `models/keras_models/` directory.

This script is a simplified representation of the model training process using mock data and serves as a starting point for training the predictive maintenance model within the industrial IoT application. Adjustments and expansions based on real data and detailed preprocessing and model tuning can be incorporated as per the requirements.

```python
# File: src/model_training/train_complex_model.py
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
import joblib

# Load mock sensor data (mock data path)
mock_data_path = 'data/raw_data/mock_sensor_data.csv'
sensor_data = pd.read_csv(mock_data_path)

# Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering
# ... (Assuming preprocessing and feature engineering steps are implemented)

# Split data into features and target
X = sensor_data.drop('target_variable', axis=1)  # Replace 'target_variable' with the actual target variable name
y = sensor_data['target_variable']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train a complex machine learning model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=10, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions and evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')

# Generate classification report for detailed performance evaluation
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
print(report)

# Save the trained model
joblib.dump(model, 'models/random_forest_model.pkl')
```
In this example, the `train_complex_model.py` script loads mock sensor data, performs data preprocessing and feature engineering, trains a complex Random Forest classifier, evaluates the model's performance, and saves the trained model in the designated directory. The mock data is assumed to be stored in a CSV file named `mock_sensor_data.csv` within the `data/raw_data/` directory. The trained model is saved as `random_forest_model.pkl` in the `models/` directory.

This script demonstrates the training of a complex machine learning algorithm using mock data, and it can serve as a basis for implementing more sophisticated models tailored to the predictive maintenance requirements within the industrial IoT application. Adjustments and expansions can be made based on the specific features and performance considerations of the target industrial IoT environment.
