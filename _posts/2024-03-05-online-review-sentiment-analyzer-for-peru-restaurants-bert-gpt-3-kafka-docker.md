   - **Lemmatization and Stemming**: Reduce words to their base forms to improve model generalization.
   - **Handling Emojis and Special Characters**: Maintain sentiment-intent emojis and symbols in a meaningful way during preprocessing.

2. **Sentiment Label Balancing**:

   - **Resampling Techniques**: Use oversampling (e.g., SMOTE) for minority classes or undersampling for majority classes to balance sentiment labels.

3. **Contextual Understanding**:

   - **N-gram Analysis**: Capture sequential word interactions and context by incorporating n-grams in text features during preprocessing.
   - **Sarcasm Detection**: Implement sentiment lexicons or heuristics to detect sarcastic tones in reviews.

4. **Metadata Standardization**:

   - **Normalization and Encoding**: Standardize metadata formats and encode categorical metadata attributes before integration with text features.
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Impute missing metadata values using appropriate techniques (e.g., mean imputation, mode imputation).

5. **Cross-Validation Strategy**:
   - **Stratified Cross-Validation**: Ensure balanced representation of sentiment labels in each fold to prevent bias during model evaluation.

By implementing these strategic data preprocessing practices tailored to address the unique challenges of noisy text data, imbalanced sentiment labels, contextual understanding, and metadata variability, the Online Review Sentiment Analyzer project can enhance data quality, ensure robustness in model training, and improve the reliability of sentiment analysis for Peru Restaurants.
