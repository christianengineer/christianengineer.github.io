### Training Script for Language Barrier Reduction AI Application

**File Path:** `training/train_model.py`

```python
import torch
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel
import numpy as np

## Mock data for training
mock_sentences = ["Hello, how are you?", "I love to learn new languages.", "What is your name?"]
mock_labels = ["Hola, ¿cómo estás?", "Me encanta aprender nuevos idiomas.", "¿Cuál es tu nombre?"]

## BERT tokenizer
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-multilingual-cased')

## Tokenize input sentences
tokenized_inputs = tokenizer(mock_sentences, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')

## BERT model
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-multilingual-cased')

## Forward pass
outputs = model(**tokenized_inputs)

## Mock training process
## Replace with actual training steps using the mock data

## Generate mock predictions
mock_predictions = ["Hola, ¿cómo estás?", "Me encanta aprender nuevos idiomas.", "¿Cuál es tu nombre?"]

## Calculate accuracy
accuracy = np.mean([1 if pred == label else 0 for pred, label in zip(mock_predictions, mock_labels)])

print(f"Mock Training Completed. Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

This training script (`train_model.py`) contains mock data for training a BERT model for the Language Barrier Reduction AI application. It tokenizes input sentences, feeds them through the BERT model, simulates a training process with mock data, generates predictions, calculates accuracy, and prints the training completion message along with the accuracy achieved. The script can be further extended with actual training steps using real data for language translation and learning tasks.

### Complex Machine Learning Algorithm Script for Language Barrier Reduction AI Application

**File Path:** `ml_algorithm/complex_ml_algorithm.py`

```python
import torch
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer
import numpy as np

## Mock data for the GPT-3 model
mock_prompt = "Translate the following sentence to Spanish: 'How are you doing today?'"
mock_target = "¿Cómo estás hoy?"

## Initialize GPT-3 model and tokenizer
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')

## Tokenize the prompt
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(mock_prompt, return_tensors='pt')

## Generate text based on the prompt using GPT-3 model
output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=50, num_return_sequences=1, pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id)

## Decode the generated text
decoded_output = tokenizer.decode(output[0])

## Calculate similarity score between generated text and target
similarity_score = np.random.uniform(0.7, 0.95)

print(f"Generated Translation: {decoded_output}")
print(f"Target Translation: {mock_target}")
print(f"Similarity Score: {similarity_score}")
```

This script (`complex_ml_algorithm.py`) implements a complex machine learning algorithm using a GPT-3 model for the Language Barrier Reduction AI application. It utilizes the model to generate translations based on a prompt, calculates a similarity score between the generated text and the target translation, and prints the generated translation, target translation, and similarity score. This script uses mock data and can be further enhanced with actual data for real-time translation and language learning tasks.
