Below is a Python script to create the dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from faker import Faker
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Initialize Faker for generating fake data
fake = Faker()

# Define the number of samples
num_samples = 10000

# Generate fictitious data for features (program descriptions, regions, population density, temporal data)
data = []
for _ in range(num_samples):
    program_description = fake.text(max_nb_chars=200)
    region = fake.city()
    population_density = np.random.randint(50, 1000)
    initiation_year = fake.year()
    
    data.append([program_description, region, population_density, initiation_year])

# Create a DataFrame from the generated data
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['program_description', 'region', 'population_density', 'initiation_year'])

# Feature engineering: Add synthetic features or interactions
# For simplicity, let's consider adding a calculated feature like 'resource_access_score'
df['resource_access_score'] = np.random.randint(1, 10, size=num_samples)

# Metadata management: Include metadata columns
df['data_source'] = 'Fictitious Data'
df['created_by'] = 'Automated Script'

# Split the dataset into training and validation sets
X = df.drop('resource_access_score', axis=1)
y = df['resource_access_score']
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Save generated dataset to CSV files
