### Explanation of Files and Structure

1. **Saved Models**
   - The `saved_models` directory organizes trained models based on the environmental parameter they are designed to predict, such as `air_quality` and `temperature`.
   - Under each environmental parameter, different machine learning or deep learning algorithms used for modeling are arranged, such as `decision_tree`, `random_forest`, `lstm`, and `linear_regression`.
   - For each algorithm and timestamp of training, a subdirectory is created. It includes the serialized model file (e.g., `model.pkl` for scikit-learn models, `model.h5` for Keras models) and a `metadata.json` file containing information about the model, such as hyperparameters, performance metrics, and model version.

2. **Model Evaluation**
   - The `model_evaluation` directory contains evaluation results for each trained model, organized by environmental parameter and algorithm used.
   - Under each environmental parameter, the subdirectories correspond to the trained models' timestamps. Each subdirectory includes an `evaluation_results.txt` file containing evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, as well as a `hyperparameters.json` file documenting the model's hyperparameters and configuration used during training.

This structured approach to organizing model artifacts and evaluation results facilitates easy management, versioning, and comparison of models for different environmental parameters, helping to maintain transparency, reproducibility, and traceability throughout the model development process.

The deployment directory plays a crucial role in organizing the files and configurations required for deploying the AI system for monitoring environmental parameters. Below is an expanded structure for the deployment directory:

### Explanation of Files and Structure

1. **Docker**
   - The `docker` directory contains the `Dockerfile` and `requirements.txt` file necessary for building a Docker image encapsulating the AI system and its dependencies.

2. **Kubernetes**
   - The `kubernetes` directory includes the Kubernetes deployment and service configuration files (`deployment.yaml` and `service.yaml`) for deploying the AI system as a containerized application on a Kubernetes cluster.

3. **Scripts**
   - The `scripts` directory holds scripts for environment setup, deployment, and other operational tasks, such as `setup.sh`, `deploy.sh`, etc.

4. **Config**
   - The `config` directory contains environment-specific configurations, including environment variables in an `environment_variables.env` file.

5. **Models**
   - The `models` directory stores the selected final models for each environmental parameter, along with their corresponding metadata files. This ensures that the required models are easily accessible for deployment.

6. **App**
   - The `app` directory contains the application code, such as the main entry point file (e.g., `main.py`) and the `requirements.txt` file listing the application's dependencies.

By structuring the deployment directory in this manner, the AI system for monitoring environmental parameters can be effectively packaged, configured, and deployed, facilitating reproducible and consistent deployments while ensuring smooth integration with different deployment environments such as Docker, Kubernetes, or traditional server deployments.

Certainly! Below is a function for a complex machine learning algorithm used in the AI system for environmental monitoring. This example uses Python and scikit-learn library to create a RandomForestClassifier for predicting air quality based on mock data. The function takes mock data from a CSV file and trains the model based on the provided features and targets.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
import joblib

def train_air_quality_model(data_file_path):
    ## Load mock data from CSV file
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Assume the CSV contains features and target columns
    features = data.drop('air_quality_label', axis=1)
    target = data['air_quality_label']

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Initialize and train the Random Forest Classifier model
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    ## Evaluate the model
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

    ## Save the trained model to a file
    model_file_path = 'models/saved_models/environmental_parameters/air_quality/random_forest_20220120/model.pkl'
    joblib.dump(model, model_file_path)

    return model_file_path, accuracy, report
```

In this example:
- `train_air_quality_model` is the function responsible for training the air quality prediction model.
- It accepts `data_file_path` as the input, which represents the file path of the mock data in a CSV file.
- The function reads the data, preprocesses it, and trains a RandomForestClassifier model.
- After training, it evaluates the model's performance and saves the trained model to a designated file path within the `models` directory.

The trained model file path, accuracy score, and a classification report are returned as outputs.

Replace `data_file_path` with the actual file path of the mock data CSV file to run the function on real data.

Certainly! Below is an example of a function for a complex deep learning algorithm used in the AI system for environmental monitoring. This example uses Python and Keras library to create a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model for predicting temperature based on mock data. The function takes mock data from a CSV file and trains the LSTM model based on the provided features and targets.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
import joblib

def train_temperature_lstm_model(data_file_path):
    ## Load mock data from CSV file
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Assume the CSV contains time series temperature data
    temperature_sequence = data['temperature'].values

    ## Prepare the data for LSTM input
    sequence_length = 10
    X, y = [], []
    for i in range(len(temperature_sequence) - sequence_length):
        X.append(temperature_sequence[i:i+sequence_length])
        y.append(temperature_sequence[i+sequence_length])
    X, y = np.array(X), np.array(y)

    ## Reshape the data for LSTM input
    X = X.reshape((X.shape[0], X.shape[1], 1))

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Initialize and train the LSTM model
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(LSTM(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(sequence_length, 1)))
    model.add(Dense(1))
    model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss='mse')
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    ## Evaluate the model
    loss = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)

    ## Save the trained model to a file
    model_file_path = 'models/saved_models/environmental_parameters/temperature/lstm_20220125/model.h5'
    model.save(model_file_path)

    return model_file_path, loss
```

In this example:
- `train_temperature_lstm_model` is the function responsible for training the temperature prediction LSTM model.
- It accepts `data_file_path` as the input, which represents the file path of the mock data in a CSV file.
- The function reads the data, preprocesses it for LSTM input, and trains an LSTM model using Keras.
- After training, it evaluates the model's performance and saves the trained model to a designated file path within the `models` directory.

The trained model file path and loss are returned as outputs.

Replace `data_file_path` with the actual file path of the mock data CSV file to run the function on real data.
