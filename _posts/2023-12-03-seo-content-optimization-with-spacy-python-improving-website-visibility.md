```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def train_and_evaluate_model(data_file_path):
    ## Load mock data from file
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Preprocessing mock data
    X = data.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
    y = data['target_variable']

    ## Split mock data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Initialize and train the machine learning model
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    ## Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    ## Evaluate model performance
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    return model, accuracy
```

In this function:

- The `train_and_evaluate_model` function takes a file path as input to load mock data for training a machine learning model.
- It preprocesses the data, splits it into training and testing sets, initializes a Random Forest Classifier, and trains the model on the mock data.
- The function then makes predictions using the trained model and evaluates its performance using accuracy as a metric.
- Finally, it returns the trained model and its accuracy score.

To use this function, provide the file path to the mock data file as an argument, for example:

```python
file_path = 'path_to_mock_data.csv'
trained_model, accuracy = train_and_evaluate_model(file_path)
print(f"Model trained with accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

def train_and_evaluate_model(data_file_path):
    ## Load mock data from file
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Preprocessing mock data
    X = data.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
    y = data['target_variable']

    ## Split mock data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Initialize and train the machine learning model
    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    ## Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    ## Evaluate model performance
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

    return model, mse
```

In this function:

- The `train_and_evaluate_model` function takes a file path as input to load mock data for training a machine learning model.
- It preprocesses the data, splits it into training and testing sets, initializes a Random Forest Regressor, and trains the model on the mock data.
- The function then makes predictions using the trained model and evaluates its performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a metric.
- Finally, it returns the trained model and its mean squared error.

To use this function, provide the file path to the mock data file as an argument, for example:

```python
file_path = 'path_to_mock_data.csv'
trained_model, mse = train_and_evaluate_model(file_path)
print(f"Model trained with Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
```
