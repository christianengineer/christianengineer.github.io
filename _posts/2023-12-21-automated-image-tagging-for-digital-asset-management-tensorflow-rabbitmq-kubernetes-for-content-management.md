model_path = '/app/models/my_model/1'  # Path to the saved model

channel = grpc.insecure_channel('localhost:8500')
stub = prediction_service_pb2_grpc.PredictionServiceStub(channel)

# Load the model
model = tf.saved_model.load(model_path)

# Define function for making predictions
def make_prediction(image):
    request = predict_pb2.PredictRequest()
    request.model_spec.name = 'my_model'
    request.model_spec.signature_name = 'serving_default'
    request.inputs['image'].CopyFrom(tf.make_tensor_proto(image))
    
    response = stub.Predict(request)

    return response

# Define API endpoint for making predictions
@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.get_json()

Here's an example of a Python script for training a model for the Automated Image Tagging for Digital Asset Management using TensorFlow with mock data. In this example, I'll create a file called `model_training.py` within the `models/training/` directory for the project:

```python
# File Path: automated_image_tagging/models/training/model_training.py

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers
import numpy as np

# Mock image data
# Assume we have mock image data stored as NumPy arrays
# Replace this with your actual image data and labels
image_data = np.random.random((100, 128, 128, 3))  # Mock image data with 100 samples of 128x128 RGB images
labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(100,))  # Mock binary labels for image tagging

# Define the model architecture
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(128, 128, 3)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(image_data, labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Save the trained model
model.save('trained_model')
```

In this example, the script generates mock image data and binary labels for image tagging. The model architecture consists of convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers. The model is then compiled and trained on the mock data. Finally, the trained model is saved to the `trained_model` directory.

You can further customize this script to use your actual image data and labels for training the image tagging model.

Certainly! Here's an example of a Python script implementing a complex machine learning algorithm (such as a pre-trained deep learning model) for the Automated Image Tagging for Digital Asset Management using TensorFlow with mock data. This script will be named `complex_model_training.py` and will reside within the `models/training/` directory of the project:

```python
# File Path: automated_image_tagging/models/training/complex_model_training.py

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras import layers
import numpy as np

# Mock image data
# Assume we have mock image data stored as NumPy arrays
# Replace this with your actual image data and labels
image_data = np.random.random((100, 224, 224, 3))  # Mock image data with 100 samples of 224x224 RGB images
labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(100,))  # Mock binary labels for image tagging

# Use a pre-trained ResNet50 model with Fine-tuning
base_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Add custom classification layers
x = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(base_model.output)
x = layers.Dense(256, activation='relu')(x)
output = layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(x)

model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=output)

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(lr=0.0001),
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Fine-tune the model with mock data
model.fit(image_data, labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Save the trained model
model.save('trained_complex_model')
```

In this example, the script utilizes a pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction and adds custom classification layers for image tagging purposes. The model is then compiled, fine-tuned on the mock data, and the trained model is saved to the `trained_complex_model` directory.

You can adapt this script to use your actual image data and labels, as well as modify the model architecture and training process based on your specific requirements.
