Below is a Python function representing a complex machine learning algorithm using mock data for the BlockAnalytix Blockchain Analytics AI application. The function demonstrates a hypothetical scenario where a deep learning model is trained on blockchain transaction data to detect anomalies.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

def train_anomaly_detection_model(data_file_path):
    ## Load mock blockchain transaction data from a CSV file
    blockchain_data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Preprocessing: Split the data into features and target
    X = blockchain_data.drop('anomaly_label', axis=1)  ## Assuming 'anomaly_label' is the target
    y = blockchain_data['anomaly_label']

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Feature scaling
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

    ## Define the deep learning model architecture
    model = Sequential([
        Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
        Dropout(0.5),
        Dense(32, activation='relu'),
        Dropout(0.3),
        Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

    ## Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    return model
```

In this function:
- The `train_anomaly_detection_model` function loads mock blockchain transaction data from a CSV file specified by the `data_file_path`.
- It then performs data preprocessing, splitting the data into features and the target variable for anomaly detection.
- The function further preprocesses the data by conducting feature scaling using `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing`.
- Next, the function defines a deep learning model using TensorFlow's Keras API, comprising multiple layers including dropout layers for regularization.
- The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss for binary classification.
- Finally, the model is trained on the preprocessed data.

Please note that the mock data file path should point to a valid CSV file containing the mock blockchain transaction data for the training of the anomaly detection model.

Here's a Python function representing a complex deep learning algorithm using mock data for the BlockAnalytix Blockchain Analytics AI application. This function demonstrates a hypothetical scenario where a deep learning model is trained on blockchain transaction data to perform transaction clustering using an autoencoder architecture for unsupervised learning.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense

def train_transaction_clustering_model(data_file_path):
    ## Load mock blockchain transaction data from a CSV file
    blockchain_data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Preprocessing: Split the data into features and target (unsupervised learning)
    X = blockchain_data.drop('transaction_id', axis=1)  ## Assuming 'transaction_id' is not relevant for clustering
    y = blockchain_data['transaction_id']  ## Assuming the IDs are used for tracking but not for clustering

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, _, _ = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Feature scaling
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

    ## Define the autoencoder architecture for transaction clustering
    input_dim = X_train.shape[1]
    encoding_dim = 32

    input_layer = Input(shape=(input_dim,))
    encoder = Dense(encoding_dim, activation='relu')(input_layer)
    decoder = Dense(input_dim, activation='sigmoid')(encoder)

    autoencoder = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=decoder)

    autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

    ## Train the autoencoder for transaction clustering
    autoencoder.fit(X_train, X_train, epochs=50, batch_size=64, shuffle=True, validation_data=(X_test, X_test))

    return autoencoder
```

In this function:
- The `train_transaction_clustering_model` function loads mock blockchain transaction data from a CSV file specified by the `data_file_path`.
- It performs data preprocessing by splitting the data into features and the target (unsupervised learning scenario).
- The function further preprocesses the data by conducting feature scaling using `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing`.
- Next, the function defines an autoencoder architecture for transaction clustering using the Keras functional API within TensorFlow.
- The autoencoder model is then compiled using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss.
- Finally, the model is trained on the preprocessed data for transaction clustering.

Please note that the mock data file path should point to a valid CSV file containing the mock blockchain transaction data for training the transaction clustering model.
