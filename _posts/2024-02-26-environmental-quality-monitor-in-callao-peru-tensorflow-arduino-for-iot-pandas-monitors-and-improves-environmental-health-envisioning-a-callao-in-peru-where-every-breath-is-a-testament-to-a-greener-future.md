This file will demonstrate the process of training a TensorFlow model on simulated environmental data to improve environmental health, aligning with the vision of creating a greener future in Callao.

```python
# train_model.py

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load mock environmental data (replace with actual data loading logic)
mock_data = pd.read_csv('/path/to/mock_data.csv')

# Preprocess mock data
features = mock_data.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
target = mock_data['target_variable']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Define a simple neural network model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train_scaled.shape[1],)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)  # assuming a regression task
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test_scaled, y_test))

# Save the trained model

features = mock_data.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
target = mock_data['target_variable']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Random Forest Regressor
random_forest = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
random_forest.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = random_forest.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")

# Save the trained model (optional)
import joblib
joblib.dump(random_forest, '/path/to/save/trained_model.pkl')
