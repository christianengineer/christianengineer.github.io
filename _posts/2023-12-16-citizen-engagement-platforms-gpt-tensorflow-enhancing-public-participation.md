Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a TensorFlow sentiment analysis model using mock data. This script leverages TensorFlow to build and train a simple sentiment analysis model using a small mock dataset.

File Path: `training_sentiment_analysis_model.py`

```python
## training_sentiment_analysis_model.py

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

## Mock data generation
## Mock features (input data)
mock_text_data = np.array(["I love this product", "This is terrible", "Neutral comment"])
## Mock labels (sentiment classes)
mock_labels = np.array([1, 0, 2])  ## 1: Positive, 0: Negative, 2: Neutral

## Text preprocessing
tokenizer = keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer()
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(mock_text_data)
tokenized_text = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(mock_text_data)
max_sequence_length = max([len(seq) for seq in tokenized_text])
padded_text_data = keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(tokenized_text, maxlen=max_sequence_length)

## Define the TensorFlow sentiment analysis model
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Embedding(input_dim=len(tokenizer.word_index) + 1, output_dim=16, input_length=max_sequence_length),
    layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
    layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')  ## 3 output classes: Positive, Negative, Neutral
])

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

## Model training
model.fit(padded_text_data, mock_labels, epochs=10)

## Save the trained model
model.save('trained_models/sentiment_analysis_model')
```

In this script, we first generate mock text data and labels for sentiment analysis, then preprocess the text data using TensorFlow's `Tokenizer` and pad sequences to ensure uniform input length. We define a simple neural network model using Keras layers for sentiment analysis, compile the model, and then train it using the mock data. Finally, we save the trained model to the `trained_models` directory.

This script serves as a simple example for training a sentiment analysis model using TensorFlow with mock data, and it can be extended to include more sophisticated models and larger, real-world datasets.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a complex machine learning algorithm for entity recognition using TensorFlow. This example leverages a more advanced neural network architecture for processing and identifying entities in text data using a mock dataset.

File Path: `training_entity_recognition_model.py`

```python
## training_entity_recognition_model.py

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

## Mock data generation
## Mock features (input data)
mock_text_data = np.array(["Apple is expected to launch a new product next month"])
## Mock labels (entity tags)
mock_entity_labels = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2]])

## Tokenization and text preprocessing
tokenizer = keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer()
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(mock_text_data)
tokenized_text = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(mock_text_data)
max_sequence_length = max([len(seq) for seq in tokenized_text])
padded_text_data = keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(tokenized_text, maxlen=max_sequence_length)

## Define the TensorFlow entity recognition model
input_layer = layers.Input(shape=(max_sequence_length,))
embedding_layer = layers.Embedding(input_dim=len(tokenizer.word_index) + 1, output_dim=32, input_length=max_sequence_length)(input_layer)
bi_lstm = layers.Bidirectional(layers.LSTM(64, return_sequences=True))(embedding_layer)
output_layer = layers.TimeDistributed(layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax'))(bi_lstm)  ## 3 entity classes: B (beginning), I (inside), O (outside)

## Build the model
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy')

## Model training
model.fit(padded_text_data, mock_entity_labels, epochs=10)

## Save the trained entity recognition model
model.save('trained_models/entity_recognition_model')
```

In this script, we create a more complex neural network architecture for entity recognition, incorporating a bidirectional LSTM layer and a time-distributed dense layer to identify entities in the input text. We preprocess the mock text data, define the entity recognition model using Keras functional API, compile the model, and then train it using the mock entity labels. Finally, we save the trained model to the `trained_models` directory.

This script serves as an example of training a complex machine learning algorithm for entity recognition using TensorFlow with mock data. It can be further extended and fine-tuned with real-world data to enhance the citizen engagement platforms' capabilities in processing and understanding citizen-generated content.
