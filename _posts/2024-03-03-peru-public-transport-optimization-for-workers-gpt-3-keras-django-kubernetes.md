I'll provide a sample Python script for training a model for the Peru Public Transport Optimization application using mock data. Below is an example of a file named `train_model.py` located in the `models/` directory:

```python
## models/train_model.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import joblib

## Mock data for training the model
X = np.random.rand(100, 1)  ## Feature matrix
y = 2 * X.squeeze() + np.random.normal(0, 1, 100)  ## Target variable

## Splitting the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Training a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Evaluating the model
train_score = model.score(X_train, y_train)
test_score = model.score(X_test, y_test)

## Saving the trained model
model_file_path = 'models/trained_models/optimal_route_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, model_file_path)

print(f"Model trained successfully. Training score: {train_score}, Testing score: {test_score}")
print(f"Trained model saved at: {model_file_path}")
```

In this script:

- We generate mock data for training the model.
- We split the data into training and testing sets.
- We train a simple linear regression model on the mock data.
- We evaluate the model performance.
- We save the trained model using `joblib` serialization.
- The trained model is saved as `optimal_route_model.pkl` in the `models/trained_models/` directory.

This file demonstrates a basic example of training a model for the Peru Public Transport Optimization application with mock data.

Here is an example of a more complex machine learning algorithm using a neural network implemented with Keras for the Peru Public Transport Optimization application. We will use mock data for training the model. Save this file as `complex_model.py` in the `models/` directory:

```python
## models/complex_model.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

## Mock data for training the model
X = np.random.rand(100, 5)  ## Mock feature matrix with 5 features
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)  ## Binary target variable

## Splitting the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Define a neural network model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(10, input_dim=5, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

## Compile the model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=Adam(), metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=16, verbose=1)

## Evaluate the model
_, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)

## Save the trained model
model_file_path = 'models/trained_models/complex_model.h5'
model.save(model_file_path)

print(f"Complex model trained successfully. Test accuracy: {accuracy}")
print(f"Trained model saved at: {model_file_path}")
```

In this script:

- We generate mock data with 5 features for training the complex model.
- We split the data into training and testing sets.
- We define a neural network model using Keras.
- The model is compiled with binary crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer.
- We train the model for 50 epochs.
- The model's test accuracy is evaluated.
- The trained model is saved as `complex_model.h5` in the `models/trained_models/` directory.
