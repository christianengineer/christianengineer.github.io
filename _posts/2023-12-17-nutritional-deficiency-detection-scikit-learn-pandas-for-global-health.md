# MLOps Infrastructure for Nutritional Deficiency Detection

## Overview
MLOps, an amalgamation of "Machine Learning" and "Operations," refers to the practice of streamlining and automating the process of deploying, managing, and monitoring machine learning models in production. For the Nutritional Deficiency Detection application, an effective MLOps infrastructure is crucial to ensure the scalability, robustness, and reliability of the machine learning models.

## Components of MLOps Infrastructure
1. **Model Training Pipeline**: Develop a pipeline to automate the training and retraining of machine learning models using the collected nutritional data. This involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and model evaluation.
2. **Model Deployment**: Create a mechanism to deploy trained models into a production environment, allowing real-time inference on new data. This may involve containerization using technologies like Docker, and orchestration using tools like Kubernetes.
3. **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement monitoring and logging mechanisms to track model performance, data drift, and system health. This can include the use of monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana.
4. **Scalable Infrastructure**: Set up a scalable and robust infrastructure, such as cloud-based resources, that can handle the computational requirements of training and serving machine learning models.
5. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Establish a CI/CD pipeline to automate the testing, deployment, and versioning of machine learning models and associated infrastructure.

## Integration with Scikit-Learn and Pandas
1. **Model Training**: Integrate Scikit-Learn into the model training pipeline to leverage its machine learning algorithms and tools for model evaluation.
2. **Data Processing**: Utilize Pandas within the data preprocessing pipeline to handle feature preprocessing, data cleaning, and transformation before model training.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a machine learning model for the Nutritional Deficiency Detection application using mock data. The script utilizes the Scikit-Learn library for model training and Pandas for data manipulation. 

Keep in mind that this is a simplified example and will require adaptation to reflect the specific features and requirements of the Nutritional Deficiency Detection application.

### File Path: `src/model_training/train_model.py`

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import joblib

# Load mock nutritional deficiency data
data_path = 'data/processed/mock_nutritional_data.csv'
nutritional_data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

# Prepare the data for model training
X = nutritional_data.drop('deficiency_label', axis=1)
y = nutritional_data['deficiency_label']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize a Random Forest classifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy}")

# Save the trained model to the models directory
model_path = 'models/classification/mock_nutritional_deficiency_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, model_path)
```

In this example script, we:
- Load mock nutritional deficiency data from a processed CSV file.

# Initialize a Gradient Boosting classifier
model = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy}")

# Generate classification report
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Save the trained model to the models directory
model_path = 'models/classification/complex_nutritional_deficiency_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, model_path)
```

In this example script, we:
- Load mock nutritional deficiency data from a processed CSV file.
- Split the data into features (X) and the target variable (y).
