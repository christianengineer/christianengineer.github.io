Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a BERT model for sentiment analysis using mock data. This script assumes the availability of a BERT model, such as those provided by the Hugging Face Transformers library, and uses PyTorch for training. The mock data is assumed to be available in a CSV file named "mock_media_data.csv" in the "data/processed/" directory.

```python
## File Path: real-time-language-processing-media-analysis/app/src/train_bert_model.py

import pandas as pd
import torch
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset
from torch.nn.utils.rnn import pad_sequence
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, RandomSampler, SequentialSampler
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset, random_split
from transformers import AdamW, get_linear_schedule_with_warmup
import numpy as np

## Load mock data from a CSV file
data_path = "../data/processed/mock_media_data.csv"
mock_data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

## Preprocess the data (e.g., tokenize text, process labels)

## Split the data into training and validation sets
train_data, validation_data = train_test_split(mock_data, test_size=0.1, random_state=42)

## Define the BERT model and tokenizer
model_name = 'bert-base-uncased'
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, num_labels=2)

## Data processing and batching (assuming 'text' and 'label' are column names in the DataFrame)
class MediaDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, texts, labels, tokenizer, max_len):
        self.texts = texts
        self.labels = labels
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer
        self.max_len = max_len
        
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.texts)
    
    def __getitem__(self, item):
        text = str(self.texts[item])
        label = self.labels[item]
        
        encoding = self.tokenizer.encode_plus(
            text,
            add_special_tokens=True,
            max_length=self.max_len,
            return_token_type_ids=False,
            pad_to_max_length=True,
            return_attention_mask=True,
            return_tensors='pt',
            truncation=True
        )
        
        return {
            'text': text,
            'input_ids': encoding['input_ids'].flatten(),
            'attention_mask': encoding['attention_mask'].flatten(),
            'label': torch.tensor(label, dtype=torch.long)
        }

## Define the data loaders
max_len = 128
batch_size = 32

train_dataset = MediaDataset(
    texts=train_data['text'].to_numpy(),
    labels=train_data['label'].to_numpy(),
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    max_len=max_len
)

train_dataloader = DataLoader(
    train_dataset,
    batch_size=batch_size,
    num_workers=4
)

## Training the BERT model
optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=2e-5, eps=1e-8)
epochs = 3
total_steps = len(train_dataloader) * epochs
scheduler = get_linear_schedule_with_warmup(optimizer, num_warmup_steps=0, num_training_steps=total_steps)

device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

model.to(device)

for epoch in range(epochs):
    model.train()
    total_loss = 0
    
    for batch in train_dataloader:
        input_ids = batch['input_ids'].to(device)
        attention_mask = batch['attention_mask'].to(device)
        labels = batch['label'].to(device)
        
        model.zero_grad()
        
        outputs = model(input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask, labels=labels)
        
        loss = outputs.loss
        total_loss += loss.item()
        
        loss.backward()
        torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), 1.0)
        
        optimizer.step()
        scheduler.step()
```

In the above example, the file "train_bert_model.py" is located within the "app/src/" directory of the project. This script demonstrates the training of a BERT model for sentiment analysis using mock data from a CSV file and leverages the Hugging Face Transformers library for the BERT model and tokenizer. It defines the data loading, model training, and optimization process using PyTorch.

Certainly! Below is an example of a file implementing a complex machine learning algorithm for media analysis using Spark's MLlib to perform text classification on mock data. This script assumes the availability of Spark and PySpark in the environment. The mock data is assumed to be available in a CSV file named "mock_media_data.csv" in the "data/processed/" directory.

```python
## File Path: real-time-language-processing-media-analysis/app/src/compute_text_classification_spark.py

from pyspark import SparkContext, SparkConf
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.ml.feature import Tokenizer, HashingTF, IDF
from pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression
from pyspark.ml import Pipeline
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import MulticlassClassificationEvaluator
from pyspark.sql import SQLContext

## Create a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("RealTimeMediaAnalysis").getOrCreate()

## Load mock data from a CSV file
data_path = "../data/processed/mock_media_data.csv"
data = spark.read.csv(data_path, header=True, inferSchema=True)

## Tokenize and transform the data
tokenizer = Tokenizer(inputCol="text", outputCol="words")
wordsData = tokenizer.transform(data)

hashingTF = HashingTF(inputCol="words", outputCol="rawFeatures", numFeatures=20)
featurizedData = hashingTF.transform(wordsData)

idf = IDF(inputCol="rawFeatures", outputCol="features")
idfModel = idf.fit(featurizedData)
rescaledData = idfModel.transform(featurizedData)

## Split the data into training and test sets
train, test = rescaledData.randomSplit([0.7, 0.3])

## Train a logistic regression model
lr = LogisticRegression(maxIter=10, regParam=0.001)
pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[lr])
model = pipeline.fit(train)

## Make predictions
predictions = model.transform(test)

## Compute evaluation metrics
evaluator = MulticlassClassificationEvaluator(labelCol="label", predictionCol="prediction", metricName="accuracy")
accuracy = evaluator.evaluate(predictions)
print("Test set accuracy = " + str(accuracy))

## Save the trained model
model.save("path_to_save_model")
```

In this example, the file "compute_text_classification_spark.py" is located within the "app/src/" directory of the project. The script demonstrates the implementation of a complex text classification algorithm using Spark's MLlib for processing and analyzing media content. It includes the steps for data preprocessing, model training, evaluating accuracy, and saving the trained model. This script assumes the availability of a Spark environment and leverages PySpark for creating and running Spark jobs.
