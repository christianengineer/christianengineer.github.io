**Primary Focus and Target Variable Selection:**

The primary focus of this project should revolve around developing a sophisticated AI system that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) for content summarization, machine learning for bias detection, and personalized algorithms for relevance filtering. The goal is to create a customized news and information filter that caters to the user's personal interests and ensures the credibility and relevance of the curated content.

**Target Variable Name:**  
`information_relevance_score`

**Importance of the Target Variable:**

The `information_relevance_score` is crucial as it encapsulates the essence of the project's objective - to provide the user with information that is both important and unbiased. This variable will be calculated based on various factors such as the user's interests, the credibility of the source, the topical relevance to the user, and the absence of bias in the content.

**Example Values and Decision Making:**

1. **User Interest Weighting:**  
   - User A is highly interested in technology news, so an article about the latest advancements in AI would receive a high score for User A, while the same article might receive a lower score for User B who is more interested in environmental news.
   
2. **Source Credibility:**  
   - An article from a renowned publication like The New York Times would be assigned a higher score compared to a blog post from an unknown source.
   
3. **Bias Detection:**  
   - If the AI system detects any bias in the content, such as political leaning or misinformation, the relevance score would be lowered to ensure the user is not exposed to biased information.

By considering these factors and assigning a comprehensive `information_relevance_score` to each piece of information, the AI system can effectively filter and prioritize content for the user, helping them manage information overload while staying informed on topics that matter to them.

**Detailed Plan for Sourcing Data:**

1. **News APIs:** Utilize news APIs such as NewsAPI (https://newsapi.org/) or Bing News Search API (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/bing-news-search-api-v7) to gather a diverse range of news articles from reputable sources across different categories.

2. **Web Scraping:** Use web scraping tools like BeautifulSoup (https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) or Scrapy (https://scrapy.org/) to extract data from news websites, blogs, and online publications to ensure a comprehensive dataset.

3. **Social Media Data:** Extract information from social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit to capture trending topics, public opinions, and user-generated content.

4. **Research Papers and Journals:** Access academic repositories like Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/) and ResearchGate (https://www.researchgate.net/) to gather scholarly articles, studies, and research papers for in-depth analysis and credibility assessment.

5. **Public Datasets:** Explore open datasets from platforms like Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) that contain relevant information for training machine learning models and bias detection algorithms.

6. **API Integration for Social Media Analysis:** Integrate social media analytics APIs like Socialbakers (https://www.socialbakers.com/) or Brandwatch (https://www.brandwatch.com/) to monitor social media trends, sentiment analysis, and user engagement with news topics.

7. **User Interaction Data:** Capture user interaction data within the AI system to understand user preferences, feedback, and behavior patterns for personalized content curation and relevance filtering.

By combining data from these varied sources, the AI system can generate a rich dataset that encompasses a wide array of news and information, enabling effective summarization, bias detection, and personalized filtering based on the user's interests and credibility metrics.

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# Fictitious Mocked Data
data = {
    'user_interest': [8, 7, 5, 9, 6],
    'source_credibility': [9, 8, 7, 7, 6],
    'bias_detection': [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
    'information_relevance_score': [85, 78, 67, 79, 72]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Define features and target variable
X = df[['user_interest', 'source_credibility', 'bias_detection']]
y = df['information_relevance_score']

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the Random Forest Regressor model
model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the target variable for the test set
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model's performance using Mean Absolute Error
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Mean Absolute Error: {mae}")
print("Predicted Information Relevance Scores:")
print(predictions)
```
