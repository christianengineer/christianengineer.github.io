To train a machine learning model for the Scalable E-commerce Search Engine using mock data, you can create a Python script for model training. Below is an example file path and content for the training script:

File Path: `machine-learning/models/product_recommendation/train_model.py`

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
import joblib

## Load mock data (replace with your actual data loading logic)
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_mock_data.csv')

## Perform data preprocessing (replace with your actual preprocessing steps)
## For example, encoding categorical variables
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
data['encoded_category'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(data['category'])

## Split data into features and target variable
X = data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'encoded_category']]
y = data['target']

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Train a machine learning model (replace with your actual model and training logic)
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Evaluate the model (replace with your actual evaluation logic)
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Model accuracy: {accuracy}')

## Save the trained model to a file
model_filename = 'product_recommendation_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, model_filename)
print(f'Trained model saved to {model_filename}')
```

In this example, the script loads mock data, preprocesses it, trains a RandomForestClassifier model, evaluates its accuracy, and finally saves the trained model to a file using joblib. You would need to replace `path_to_mock_data.csv`, the data preprocessing logic, and the model training logic with your actual data and modeling requirements.

This script provides a starting point for training a machine learning model for product recommendation using mock data. As you proceed with building more sophisticated models, you can further refine the training process and incorporate more advanced techniques as needed.

File Path: `machine-learning/models/product_recommendation/complex_model.py`

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
import joblib

def preprocess_data(data):
    ## Perform data preprocessing
    ## Example: Standardize numerical features
    numerical_features = ['feature1', 'feature2']
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    data[numerical_features] = scaler.fit_transform(data[numerical_features])
    return data

## Load mock data (replace with your actual data loading logic)
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_mock_data.csv')

## Perform data preprocessing
data = preprocess_data(data)

## Split data into features and target variable
X = data.drop(columns=['target_column'])
y = data['target_column']

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Define and train a complex machine learning algorithm
model = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3, random_state=42))
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Evaluate the model
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Model accuracy: {accuracy}')

## Save the trained model to a file
model_filename = 'complex_product_recommendation_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, model_filename)
print(f'Trained model saved to {model_filename}')
```

In this example, the script defines a more complex machine learning algorithm using a Gradient Boosting Classifier encapsulated within a pipeline that includes standardization of numerical features. The script also includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model to a file using joblib.

You would need to replace `path_to_mock_data.csv`, the data preprocessing logic, and the model training logic with your actual data and modeling requirements. Additionally, consider incorporating more advanced techniques such as hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and model validation to further enhance the performance and robustness of the machine learning algorithm.
