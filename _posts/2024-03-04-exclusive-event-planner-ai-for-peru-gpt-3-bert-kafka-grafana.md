# Load the mocked data
df = pd.read_csv('mocked_event_data.csv')

# Perform one-hot encoding for categorical features
enc = OneHotEncoder()
encoded_features = enc.fit_transform(df[['event_type', 'favorite_cuisine', 'dietary_restriction', 'event_preference', 'event_budget']])

# Scale numerical features
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_features = scaler.fit_transform(df[['guest_age']])

# Combine encoded and scaled features
X = pd.concat([pd.DataFrame(encoded_features.toarray()), pd.DataFrame(scaled_features)], axis=1)
