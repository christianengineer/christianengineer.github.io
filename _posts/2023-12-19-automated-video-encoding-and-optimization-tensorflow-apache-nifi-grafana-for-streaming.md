Certainly! Below is an example of a file for training a model for the Automated Video Encoding and Optimization system using mock data.

### File Path:

- **/models/tensorflow_models/inception_v3/training_code/train_model.py**

### Example Training Script:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import InceptionV3
from tensorflow.keras import layers, Model

## Mock training data
mock_training_data_path = '/data/training_data/mock_video_dataset'

## Load and preprocess the mock training data
train_ds = tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory(
    mock_training_data_path,
    validation_split=0.2,
    subset="training",
    seed=123,
    image_size=(299, 299),
    batch_size=32)

val_ds = tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory(
    mock_training_data_path,
    validation_split=0.2,
    subset="validation",
    seed=123,
    image_size=(299, 299),
    batch_size=32)

## Load the InceptionV3 model without its top layer for transfer learning
base_model = InceptionV3(weights='imagenet', include_top=False)

## Add custom classification layers on top of the InceptionV3 base model
x = base_model.output
x = layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)
predictions = layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(x)

## Create the final model for training
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
model.fit(
    train_ds,
    validation_data=val_ds,
    epochs=10
)

## Save the trained model
model.save('/models/tensorflow_models/inception_v3/inception_v3_trained_model')
```

In this example, the script loads mock video training data from a specified directory, builds an InceptionV3-based model, compiles the model, and trains it using the mock data. After training, the script saves the trained model to the specified directory. This file can be used to train and optimize models for video content analysis within the Automated Video Encoding and Optimization system.

Certainly! Below is an example of a file for a complex machine learning algorithm, such as a custom Neural Network, for the Automated Video Encoding and Optimization system using mock data.

### File Path:

- **/models/tensorflow_models/custom_nn_model/training_code/train_custom_nn_model.py**

### Example Training Script for Custom Neural Network Model:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, Model

## Mock training data
mock_training_data_path = '/data/training_data/mock_video_dataset'

## Load and preprocess the mock training data
## (Assuming the data is preprocessed and stored as numpy arrays or in a compatible format)
train_data, train_labels = load_and_preprocess_data(mock_training_data_path)

## Define the architecture of the custom neural network model
input_layer = layers.Input(shape=(...))  ## Input shape based on the preprocessed video data
x = layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input_layer)
x = layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2))(x)
x = layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu')(x)
x = layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2))(x)
x = layers.Flatten()(x)
x = layers.Dense(256, activation='relu')(x)
output_layer = layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(x)  ## Output layer based on the number of classes

## Create the custom neural network model
model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

## Save the trained custom neural network model
model.save('/models/tensorflow_models/custom_nn_model/trained_model')
```

In this example, the script loads mock video training data, defines a custom neural network architecture, compiles the model, and trains it using the mock data. After training, the script saves the trained custom neural network model to the specified directory. This file can be used to train complex machine learning models for video content analysis within the Automated Video Encoding and Optimization system.
