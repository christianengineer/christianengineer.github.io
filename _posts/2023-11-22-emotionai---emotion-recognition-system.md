```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def train_emotion_detection_model(data_file_path):
    ## Load the mock data from the specified file path
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Split the data into features and target variable
    X = data.drop('emotion_label', axis=1)
    y = data['emotion_label']

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Initialize the Random Forest classifier
    rf_classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

    ## Train the classifier on the training data
    rf_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

    ## Make predictions on the test data
    y_pred = rf_classifier.predict(X_test)

    ## Evaluate the model performance
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    return rf_classifier, accuracy
```

In this function:

- The `train_emotion_detection_model` function takes a file path as input to load the mock data.
- The data is then split into features (X) and the target variable (y).
- Subsequently, the data is split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn.
- A Random Forest classifier is initialized and trained on the training data.
- Predictions are made on the test data, and the accuracy of the model is computed using the `accuracy_score` function.
- The function returns the trained Random Forest classifier along with its accuracy.

This function represents a simplified example of training a machine learning model for emotion detection using a Random Forest classifier with mock data. The actual implementation would involve leveraging deep learning models and real multimedia data for emotion recognition in the EmotionAI - Emotion Recognition System application.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def train_deep_emotion_model(data_file_path):
    ## Load the mock data from the specified file path
    data = np.load(data_file_path)

    ## Assume data is preprocessed and includes features and emotion labels

    X = data['features']
    y = data['emotion_labels']

    ## Encode emotion labels to numerical values
    label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
    y = label_encoder.fit_transform(y)

    ## Normalize feature data
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_normalized = scaler.fit_transform(X)

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_normalized, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Build a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(7, activation='softmax)  ## Assuming 7 emotion classes
    ])

    ## Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    ## Evaluate the model performance
    _, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)

    return model, accuracy
```

In this function:

- The `train_deep_emotion_model` function takes a file path as input to load the mock data.
- The data, assumed to be preprocessed, includes features and emotion labels, which are encoded and normalized.
- The data is split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function.
- A deep learning model is built using TensorFlow/Keras, comprising multiple dense layers with activation functions suitable for emotion recognition tasks.
- The model is compiled, specifying the optimizer, loss function, and metrics for evaluation.
- The model is trained using the training data and validated against the testing data.
- The function returns the trained deep learning model along with its accuracy.

This function presents a simplified depiction of training a deep learning model for emotion recognition using mock data. In actual implementation, real multimedia data and more sophisticated neural network architectures would be utilized for emotion recognition in the EmotionAI - Emotion Recognition System application.
