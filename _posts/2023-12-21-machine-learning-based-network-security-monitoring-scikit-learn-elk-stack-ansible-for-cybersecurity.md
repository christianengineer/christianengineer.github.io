### Objectives:
The objective of the AI Machine Learning-based Network Security Monitoring repository is to leverage machine learning techniques to enhance network security monitoring. This involves detecting anomalies, identifying potential threats, and responding to security incidents in real-time. The system aims to provide a scalable and data-intensive approach to network security, utilizing the Scikit-Learn library for machine learning, the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) Stack for data storage and visualization, and Ansible for automating security response actions.

### System Design Strategies:
1. **Data Collection**: Utilize Logstash to collect and parse network logs, such as firewall logs, network traffic logs, and server logs, and store them in Elasticsearch for real-time analysis.

2. **Machine Learning Models**: Use Scikit-Learn to build and train machine learning models for anomaly detection, intrusion detection, and threat classification based on the collected network data.

3. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Employ Kibana for real-time visualization of network security data and anomalies detected by the machine learning models.

4. **Automated Response**: Utilize Ansible for automating security response actions based on the insights from the machine learning models and security monitoring data.

5. **Scalability**: Design the system to handle large volumes of network data, scalable machine learning model training, and real-time monitoring to accommodate the dynamic nature of network traffic and potential security threats.

6. **Security and Compliance**: Ensure that the system complies with security standards and regulations, securing both the data and the infrastructure.

### Chosen Libraries:
1. **Scikit-Learn**: This library provides a wide range of machine learning algorithms and tools for building and training machine learning models, making it suitable for anomaly detection and threat classification.

2. **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: Elasticsearch provides a scalable and real-time data store for network logs, Logstash facilitates the collection and parsing of logs, and Kibana offers a platform for real-time visualization and monitoring of security data.

3. **Ansible**: Ansible is used to automate security response actions, allowing for quick and consistent responses to security incidents based on insights from the machine learning models and security monitoring data.

By implementing this system design strategy and using these chosen libraries, the AI Machine Learning-based Network Security Monitoring repository aims to provide a comprehensive and effective approach to enhancing network security through the use of machine learning and scalable, data-intensive applications.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a machine learning model for anomaly detection using Scikit-Learn. This script uses mock data for demonstration purposes.

### File Path: `app/model_training.py`

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
import joblib

# Load mock data for training (replace with actual data source)
data_path = 'data/processed/feature_engineered_data.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

# Assuming 'is_anomalous' is the target variable denoting anomalies
X = data.drop(columns=['is_anomalous'])
y = data['is_anomalous']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the Isolation Forest model for anomaly detection
isolation_forest = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1, random_state=42)
isolation_forest.fit(X_train)

# Evaluate the model
train_predictions = isolation_forest.predict(X_train)
test_predictions = isolation_forest.predict(X_test)

# Save the trained model to the models/training directory
model_path = 'models/training/anomaly_detection_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(isolation_forest, model_path)

print("Anomaly detection model trained and saved successfully.")
```

In this script, the mock data is loaded from the 'data/processed/feature_engineered_data.csv' file. It then trains an Isolation Forest model for anomaly detection using Scikit-Learn and saves the trained model to the 'models/training/anomaly_detection_model.pkl' file.

This script provides a simplistic example of how a machine learning model could be trained for anomaly detection using Scikit-Learn. In a real-world scenario, data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and more advanced model selection processes would be incorporated.

The code can be further integrated into the repository's application components for the Machine Learning-based Network Security Monitoring system, utilizing the Scikit-Learn library and ELK Stack for data storage and visualization to enhance cybersecurity applications.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a complex machine learning algorithm, such as a Random Forest Classifier, for threat classification using Scikit-Learn. This script uses mock data for demonstration purposes.

### File Path: `app/model_training_complex.py`

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
import joblib

# Load mock data for training (replace with actual data source)
data_path = 'data/processed/feature_engineered_data.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

# Assuming 'threat_type' is the target variable denoting threat classifications
X = data.drop(columns=['threat_type'])
y = data['threat_type']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the Random Forest Classifier for threat classification
random_forest = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=10, random_state=42)
random_forest.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
train_predictions = random_forest.predict(X_train)
test_predictions = random_forest.predict(X_test)

# Generate a classification report for model evaluation
evaluation_report = classification_report(y_test, test_predictions)

# Save the trained model to the models/training directory
model_path = 'models/training/threat_classification_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(random_forest, model_path)

# Save the evaluation report to the models/evaluation directory
evaluation_report_path = 'models/evaluation/threat_classification_evaluation_report.txt'
with open(evaluation_report_path, 'w') as file:
    file.write(evaluation_report)

print("Threat classification model trained and saved successfully.")
```

In this script, the mock data is loaded from the 'data/processed/feature_engineered_data.csv' file. It then trains a Random Forest Classifier model for threat classification and saves the trained model to the 'models/training/threat_classification_model.pkl' file. Additionally, the classification report is saved to the 'models/evaluation/threat_classification_evaluation_report.txt' file for evaluation purposes.

This script showcases a more advanced machine learning model training process using Scikit-Learn. It aims to demonstrate the training of a complex algorithm for threat classification with subsequent model evaluation using mock data.
