```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

def complex_energy_prediction_model(data_file_path):
    # Load the mock energy usage data from the specified file path
    energy_data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Feature engineering and preprocessing
    # ... (code for feature engineering and preprocessing)

    # Split the data into features and target variable
    X = energy_data.drop('energy_consumption', axis=1)
    y = energy_data['energy_consumption']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Instantiate the complex machine learning algorithm (Random Forest Regressor in this example)
    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

    return model, mse
```

In this example, the `complex_energy_prediction_model` function represents a complex machine learning algorithm for energy consumption prediction within the EnergySaver application. The function accepts a file path pointing to mock energy usage data, loads the data, performs feature engineering and preprocessing (omitted for brevity), trains a Random Forest Regressor model, makes predictions on a test set, and evaluates the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the metric.

This function encapsulates the entire pipeline for training and evaluating a complex machine learning algorithm and showcases the integration of the algorithm with the mock data. The implementation allows for further refinement and extension to incorporate actual energy usage data and more sophisticated model training techniques.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

def complex_energy_deep_learning_model(data_file_path):
    # Load the mock energy usage data from the specified file path
    energy_data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Feature engineering and preprocessing
    # ... (code for feature engineering and preprocessing)

    # Split the data into features and target variable
    X = energy_data.drop('energy_consumption', axis=1)
    y = energy_data['energy_consumption']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Standardize the data
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

    # Define a complex deep learning model
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)  # Output layer
    ])

    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test_scaled, y_test))

    # Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)

    # Invert the scaling for evaluation
    y_pred = scaler.inverse_transform(y_pred).flatten()
    y_test = scaler.inverse_transform(y_test.values.reshape(-1, 1)).flatten()

    # Evaluate the model
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

    return model, mse
```

In this example, the `complex_energy_deep_learning_model` function represents a complex deep learning algorithm for energy consumption prediction within the EnergySaver application. The function follows a similar structure to the previous example while introducing deep learning elements using TensorFlow.

The function loads the mock energy usage data, performs feature engineering and preprocessing, scales the data, defines a deep learning model using TensorFlow's Keras API, compiles and trains the model, makes predictions, and evaluates the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the metric.

This function encapsulates the entire pipeline for training and evaluating a complex deep learning algorithm and demonstrates the integration of deep learning techniques with the mock energy usage data. The implementation can be further refined and extended to accommodate actual energy usage data and more advanced deep learning model architectures.
