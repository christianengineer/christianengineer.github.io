Certainly! Below is a sample file `train_model.py` for training a TensorFlow model in the Advanced Weather Prediction System using mock data.

```python
## File Path: advanced-weather-prediction/models/tensorflow_model/train_model.py

import tensorflow as tf
from data_processing import data_loading
from model_definition import create_weather_prediction_model
from model_evaluation import evaluate_model

## Load mock data for training
train_data, train_labels = data_loading.load_mock_training_data()

## Create and compile the TensorFlow model
weather_model = create_weather_prediction_model()
weather_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

## Train the model
history = weather_model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_split=0.2)

## Evaluate the trained model
evaluation_results = evaluate_model(weather_model, train_data, train_labels)
print("Evaluation Results:", evaluation_results)

## Save the trained model
weather_model.save('models/tensorflow_model/serving/model_artifacts/weather_prediction_model')
```

In this file, we assume that the mock training data is loaded from the `data_processing` submodule and the TensorFlow model is defined in a separate `model_definition` module. The trained model artifacts are saved within the TensorFlow model directory for serving.

This file would typically be located at the following path within the repository:
`advanced-weather-prediction/models/tensorflow_model/train_model.py`

Note that this is a simplified example using mock data. In a real-world scenario, the training process would involve loading real data, preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and potentially distributed training with Dask for large-scale climate data analysis.

Certainly! Below is a sample file `complex_model.py` that showcases a complex machine learning algorithm using TensorFlow and Dask for the Advanced Weather Prediction System. This algorithm could represent a more sophisticated deep learning model designed to process climate data for weather prediction.

```python
## File Path: advanced-weather-prediction/models/complex_model.py

import tensorflow as tf
import dask.dataframe as dd
from dask_ml.model_selection import train_test_split
from dask.distributed import Client
from dask_tensorflow import start_tensorflow

## Start the TensorFlow cluster using Dask
client = Client()
start_tensorflow(client)

## Load mock climate data using Dask
climate_data = dd.read_csv('path_to_mock_climate_data.csv')

## Preprocess the climate data
## ...

## Define a complex deep learning model using TensorFlow
def create_complex_model(input_shape):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        ## Add complex deep learning layers, such as Convolutional and Recurrent layers
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
        tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(climate_data, climate_data['target_column'])

## Create and train the complex model
input_shape = (input_features,)  ## Define the input shape based on the features in the climate data
complex_model = create_complex_model(input_shape)
complex_model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)

## Evaluate the trained model
loss, accuracy = complex_model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print("Test Accuracy:", accuracy)

## Save the trained model
complex_model.save('models/complex_model/trained_model')
```

In this file, we leverage Dask for distributed data processing and TensorFlow for building a complex deep learning model. The file resides at the following path within the repository:
`advanced-weather-prediction/models/complex_model.py`

In a real-world scenario, the data preprocessing, model definition, and training process would be more comprehensive and adapted to real climate data. The use of Dask enables distributed training and processing for large-scale climate datasets, while TensorFlow provides the flexibility to design intricate deep learning models for weather prediction.
