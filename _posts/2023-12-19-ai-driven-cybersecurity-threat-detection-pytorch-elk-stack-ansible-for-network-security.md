    └── hpa.yaml                    # Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler configuration for scalability
```

In this structure:
- The `ansible` directory contains Ansible playbooks for automated response and orchestration, enabling the system to react quickly and effectively to potential security threats. It also includes an inventory file that specifies the target hosts and groups for Ansible operations.
- The `dockerfiles` directory includes Dockerfiles for containerizing different components of the application, such as the PyTorch model service, ELK Stack, and an overall application container. This allows for efficient deployment and management of the application in containerized environments.
- The `kubernetes` directory provides Kubernetes deployment configurations for deploying the overall application, specifying the deployment, service, and Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) configurations for scalability in a Kubernetes cluster.

This structure facilitates the deployment and orchestration of the AI-driven Cybersecurity Threat Detection application by providing the necessary files and configurations for automating responses, containerization, and deployment in container orchestration environments like Kubernetes.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a PyTorch model for the AI-driven Cybersecurity Threat Detection application using mock data. This example assumes that you have mock data stored in a CSV file called `mock_network_data.csv` within a `data` directory in the root of the project.

```python
# File: model_training.py
# Location: models/pytorch/model_training.py

import pandas as pd
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.nn.functional as F
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load mock network data
data_path = '../data/raw_data/mock_network_data.csv'  # Assuming the mock data file is stored in data/raw_data directory
network_data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

# Preprocess the data and split into features and labels
# ... (Preprocessing steps)

# Split the data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define the PyTorch model architecture
class NetworkSecurityModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim):
        super(NetworkSecurityModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 32)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(32, output_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

# Instantiate the model
input_dim = X_train.shape[1]
output_dim = 1  # Assuming binary classification for security threat detection
model = NetworkSecurityModel(input_dim, output_dim)

# Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Train the model
num_epochs = 10
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(X_train)
    loss = criterion(outputs, y_train.unsqueeze(1).float())
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Save the trained model
model_path = '../models/pytorch/network_security_model.pth'  # Save the trained model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), model_path)
print(f"Trained model saved at {model_path}")
```

In this example, the script `model_training.py` is located in the `models/pytorch` directory within the project. The mock network data is loaded from `../data/raw_data/mock_network_data.csv`, and the trained PyTorch model is saved to `../models/pytorch/network_security_model.pth` after training.

A more complete implementation would include data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation. Additionally, it's important to note that this example assumes a simplified and generic model training process using PyTorch and mock data. In a real-world scenario, more advanced data preprocessing, model validation, and hyperparameter optimization techniques would be necessary.

Certainly! Here's an example of a file implementing a more complex machine learning algorithm for the AI-driven Cybersecurity Threat Detection application using PyTorch and mock data. In this example, we'll implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for threat detection based on network traffic data. This script assumes that you have mock data stored in a CSV file called `mock_network_data.csv` within a `data` directory in the root of the project.

```python
# File: cnn_model_training.py
# Location: models/pytorch/cnn_model_training.py

import pandas as pd
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# Load mock network data
data_path = '../data/raw_data/mock_network_data.csv'
network_data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

# Preprocess the data and convert to PyTorch tensors
# ... (Preprocessing steps to transform the data into tensors)

# Split the data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define the CNN model architecture
class NetworkSecurityCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(NetworkSecurityCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(fc1_in_features, fc1_out_features)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(fc2_in_features, fc2_out_features)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(fc3_in_features, output_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, fc1_in_features)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

# Instantiate the CNN model
model = NetworkSecurityCNN()

# Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Convert data to PyTorch DataLoader
train_dataset = TensorDataset(X_train, y_train)
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)

# Train the CNN model
num_epochs = 10
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for inputs, labels in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

# Save the trained CNN model
model_path = '../models/pytorch/network_security_cnn_model.pth'
torch.save(model.state_dict(), model_path)
print(f"Trained CNN model saved at {model_path}")
```

In this example, the script `cnn_model_training.py` is located in the `models/pytorch` directory within the project. The mock network data is loaded from `../data/raw_data/mock_network_data.csv`, and the trained CNN model is saved to `../models/pytorch/network_security_cnn_model.pth` after training.

Please note that this example serves as a simplified demonstration of training a CNN model using PyTorch and mock data. In a real-world scenario, more advanced data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and model validation would be essential for building an effective AI-driven Cybersecurity Threat Detection system.
