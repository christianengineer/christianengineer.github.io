For instance, `model_inference_deployment.yaml` defines the deployment and service specifications for the model inference service, while `robotic_system_controller.yaml` outlines the configuration for the controller and pods managing the robotic system. These YAML files provide the necessary specifications for deploying and managing the application in a Kubernetes cluster, ensuring scalability and resilience.

By leveraging the contents of the `deployment/` directory, the waste management application can be effectively containerized and deployed using Docker and Kubernetes, enabling efficient management, scaling, and orchestration of the system components powered by OpenCV and TensorFlow.

```python
# train_model.py

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Define mock data path
mock_data_path = '/path/to/mock/data/'

# Load mock data
# Replace this with actual data loading code
mock_images, mock_labels = load_mock_data(mock_data_path)

# Preprocess and augment mock data
preprocessed_data = preprocess_data(mock_images, mock_labels)

# Define model architecture
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(6, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(preprocessed_data, epochs=10, validation_split=0.1)

# Save the trained model
model.save('/path/to/trained/model/material_classifier.h5')
```

In this Python script `train_model.py`, the mock data for training the machine learning model is loaded from a specific path `/path/to/mock/data/`. The data is then preprocessed, and a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) model is defined using TensorFlow's Keras API. The model is compiled and trained on the mock data, and the trained model is saved to a file path `/path/to/trained/model/material_classifier.h5`.

This script serves as a starting point for training a model for the Recycling Sorting Robots application using mock data. Before using this script with actual data, the functions `load_mock_data(...)` and `preprocess_data(...)` need to be replaced with the actual code for loading and preprocessing the real data.

```python
# complex_model.py

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Define mock data path
mock_data_path = '/path/to/mock/data/'

# Load mock data
# Replace this with actual data loading code
mock_images, mock_labels = load_mock_data(mock_data_path)

# Preprocess and augment mock data
preprocessed_data = preprocess_data(mock_images, mock_labels)

# Define the input shape
input_shape = preprocessed_data[0].shape

# Build a complex convolutional neural network (CNN) model
input_layer = Input(shape=input_shape)
conv1 = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(input_layer)
pool1 = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(conv1)
conv2 = Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')(pool1)
pool2 = MaxPooling2D((2, 2))(conv2)
flatten = Flatten()(pool2)
dense1 = Dense(128, activation='relu')(flatten)
dropout = Dropout(0.5)(dense1)
output_layer = Dense(6, activation='softmax')(dropout)

# Create the model
model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(preprocessed_data, epochs=15, validation_split=0.2, batch_size=64)

# Save the trained model
model.save('/path/to/trained/model/complex_material_classifier.h5')
```

In the `complex_model.py` Python script, a more complex convolutional neural network (CNN) model is defined using TensorFlow's Keras API to train the Recycling Sorting Robots application. The mock data is loaded from the specified path `/path/to/mock/data/`, preprocessed, and augmented before being used for training the model. After compiling the model with the Adam optimizer and appropriate loss function and metrics, the model is trained on the mock data with a validation split. Finally, the trained model is saved to the file path `/path/to/trained/model/complex_material_classifier.h5`.

As with the previous example, the functions `load_mock_data(...)` and `preprocess_data(...)` should be replaced with actual code for loading and preprocessing real data. Additionally, the model architecture and training parameters can be further customized to suit the specific requirements of the waste management application.
