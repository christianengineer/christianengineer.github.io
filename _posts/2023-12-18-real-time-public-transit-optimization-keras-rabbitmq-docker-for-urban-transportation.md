## Mock data for transit demand prediction model training
num_samples = 1000
num_features = 5
X_train = np.random.rand(num_samples, num_features)
y_train = np.random.rand(num_samples)

## Define and compile the Keras model
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(num_features,)),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1)  ## Output layer for regression
])
