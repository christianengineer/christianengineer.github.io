Certainly! Below is an example of a script for training a machine learning model using Scikit-Learn with mock data for the Real-time Sports Analytics for Performance Improvement application.

**File Path:** `models/model_scripts/train_player_performance_model.py`

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import joblib
import json

# Load mock data (replace with actual data loading logic)
mock_player_data = pd.read_csv('data/raw_data/mock_player_data.csv')

# Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering
X = mock_player_data.drop(['player_id', 'performance_metric'], axis=1)
y = mock_player_data['performance_metric']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
train_score = model.score(X_train_scaled, y_train)
test_score = model.score(X_test_scaled, y_test)

# Save the trained model and scaler
joblib.dump(model, 'models/trained_models/player_performance/model.pkl')
joblib.dump(scaler, 'models/trained_models/player_performance/scaler.pkl')

# Save model metadata
model_info = {
    'model_type': 'LinearRegression',
    'features': list(X.columns),
    'train_score': train_score,
    'test_score': test_score
}
with open('models/trained_models/player_performance/model_metadata/model_info.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(model_info, file)

print("Training of player performance model complete.")
```

In this example, the script loads mock player data, preprocesses the data, trains a simple Linear Regression model using Scikit-Learn, and saves the trained model, scaler, and model metadata to the specified directories. This script demonstrates the process of training a model and saving the artifacts for the Real-time Sports Analytics for Performance Improvement application.

Please note that the data loading and preprocessing steps are simplified for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, more comprehensive data processing and feature engineering would be necessary.

The provided file path is for organization within the project structure, allowing developers to easily locate and manage the training scripts for different models in the application.

Certainly! Below is an example of a script for training a complex machine learning algorithm, such as a Gradient Boosting model, using Scikit-Learn with mock data for the Real-time Sports Analytics for Performance Improvement application.

**File Path:** `models/model_scripts/train_game_strategy_model.py`

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import joblib
import json

# Load mock data (replace with actual data loading logic)
mock_game_data = pd.read_csv('data/raw_data/mock_game_data.csv')

# Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering
X = mock_game_data.drop(['game_id', 'opponent', 'outcome'], axis=1)
y = mock_game_data['outcome']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Train a Gradient Boosting model
model = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
train_score = model.score(X_train_scaled, y_train)
test_score = model.score(X_test_scaled, y_test)

# Save the trained model and scaler
joblib.dump(model, 'models/trained_models/game_strategy/model.pkl')
joblib.dump(scaler, 'models/trained_models/game_strategy/scaler.pkl')

# Save model metadata
model_info = {
    'model_type': 'GradientBoostingClassifier',
    'features': list(X.columns),
    'train_score': train_score,
    'test_score': test_score
}
with open('models/trained_models/game_strategy/model_metadata/model_info.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(model_info, file)

print("Training of game strategy model complete.")
```

This script follows a similar structure to the previous example but demonstrates the training of a more complex machine learning algorithm, Gradient Boosting Classifier in this case, using mock game data for the Real-time Sports Analytics for Performance Improvement application. 

As before, please note that the data loading and preprocessing steps are simplified for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, more comprehensive data processing and feature engineering would be necessary.
