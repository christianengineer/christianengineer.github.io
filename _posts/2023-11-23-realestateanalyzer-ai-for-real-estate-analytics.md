Certainly! Below is an example of a function for a complex machine learning algorithm using mock data for the RealEstateAnalyzer AI application. In this example, we'll create a function for a Gradient Boosting Regressor model using scikit-learn for predicting real estate property prices. We'll also include a mock file path for the model training data.

```python
## app/models/machine_learning/regression.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

def train_gradient_boosting_model(data_file_path):
    ## Load the mock training data from the specified file path
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Assume that the dataset contains features and target variable 'price'
    X = data.drop('price', axis=1)
    y = data['price']

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Initialize the Gradient Boosting Regressor model
    model = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3, loss='ls')

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    ## Evaluate the model on the test set
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
    print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")

    ## Return the trained model
    return model

## Mock file path for the training data
file_path = 'data/processed_data/training_data.csv'

## Train the Gradient Boosting Regressor model using the mock data
trained_model = train_gradient_boosting_model(file_path)
```

In this example, we have defined a function `train_gradient_boosting_model` that takes a file path to the mock training data as input and trains a Gradient Boosting Regressor model using that data. The function then evaluates the model's performance and returns the trained model. Finally, we demonstrate how to call this function with a mock file path to initiate model training.

This script assumes that the mock training data is stored in a CSV file located at `data/processed_data/training_data.csv`. In a real-world scenario, this function would load actual real estate data for model training.

Sure, here's an example of a function for a complex deep learning algorithm using mock data for the RealEstateAnalyzer AI application. In this example, we'll create a function for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow and Keras for image recognition of real estate property features. We'll include a mock file path for the image data.

```python
## app/models/deep_learning/image_recognition.py

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def train_image_recognition_model(image_data_path):
    ## Load and preprocess the mock image data from the specified file path
    ## Here, we assume image_data_path contains the paths to the image files and their corresponding labels
    ## Placeholder for loading and preprocessing image data using libraries such as TensorFlow or OpenCV

    ## Define a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image recognition
    model = keras.Sequential([
        layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Flatten(),
        layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])

    ## Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])

    ## Assume X contains the preprocessed images and y contains the corresponding labels
    ## This is a placeholder for the actual data loading and preprocessing
    X = np.random.rand(100, 64, 64, 3)  ## Mock image data
    y = np.random.randint(10, size=(100,))  ## Mock labels

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

    ## Return the trained model
    return model

## Mock file path for the image data
image_data_path = 'data/raw_images/property_images/'

## Train the CNN image recognition model using the mock image data
trained_image_recognition_model = train_image_recognition_model(image_data_path)
```

In this example, we have defined a function `train_image_recognition_model` that takes a file path to the mock image data as input and trains a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image recognition using TensorFlow and Keras. The function then returns the trained model. Finally, we demonstrate how to call this function with a mock file path to initiate model training.

This script assumes that the mock image data is stored in a directory located at `data/raw_images/property_images/`. In a real-world scenario, this function would load actual real estate property images for model training and recognition.
