Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a model using mock data for the Automated Drug Discovery application. The file is named `train_model.py` and is located in the `models/` directory of the project.

```python
## models/train_model.py

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

## Load mock data (replace with actual data loading logic)
data = pd.read_csv('data/processed/train/train_data.csv')
labels = pd.read_csv('data/processed/train/train_labels.csv')

## Split the data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(data, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Define the neural network architecture
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1)  ## Example output layer for regression
])

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error', metrics=['mae'])

## Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))

## Save the trained model
model.save('trained_models/drug_discovery_model.h5')
```

In this example, the script loads mock training data from CSV files, defines a simple neural network architecture using Keras, compiles the model, trains it on the mock data, and finally saves the trained model to a file.

Please note that in a real-world scenario, the data loading, preprocessing, and model architecture would be more complex and may involve feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and other considerations. Additionally, error handling, logging, and reproducibility measures should be added for production use.

This file is saved as `train_model.py` in the `models/` directory of the project.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for defining and training a complex machine learning algorithm using mock data for the Automated Drug Discovery application. The file is named `complex_model_training.py` and is located in the `models/` directory of the project.

```python
## models/complex_model_training.py

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

## Load mock data (replace with actual data loading logic)
data = pd.read_csv('data/processed/train/train_data.csv')
labels = pd.read_csv('data/processed/train/train_labels.csv')

## Split the data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(data, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Data preprocessing
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_val_scaled = scaler.transform(X_val)

## Define a complex neural network architecture using Keras functional API
input_dim = X_train.shape[1]
input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(input_dim,))
hidden_1 = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(input_layer)
hidden_2 = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(hidden_1)
concat = layers.Concatenate()([input_layer, hidden_2])
output = layers.Dense(1)(concat)

model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output)

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error', metrics=['mae'])

## Define early stopping callback
early_stopping = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=5)

## Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32,
                    validation_data=(X_val_scaled, y_val), callbacks=[early_stopping])

## Save the trained model
model.save('trained_models/complex_drug_discovery_model.h5')
```

In this example, the script loads mock training data from CSV files, preprocesses the data using standard scaling, defines a complex neural network architecture using the Keras functional API, compiles the model, trains it on the mock data, and saves the trained model to a file.

Please note that the actual implementation of a complex machine learning algorithm may involve additional considerations such as hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and handling of unstructured data (e.g., molecular structures). This example demonstrates a simplified neural network architecture for illustrative purposes.

This file is saved as `complex_model_training.py` in the `models/` directory of the project.
