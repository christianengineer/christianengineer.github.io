```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

def complex_machine_learning_algorithm(data_file_path):
    # Load mock data
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Preprocessing and feature engineering
    X = data.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
    y = data['target_variable']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Instantiate the RandomForestRegressor model
    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")

    # Return the trained model for deployment
    return model
```

In this function, the `complex_machine_learning_algorithm` takes a file path for the mock data as input. It loads the data, performs preprocessing and feature engineering, splits the data into training and testing sets, instantiates a RandomForestRegressor model, trains the model, makes predictions, evaluates the model using mean squared error, and finally returns the trained model for deployment.

You would need to replace `'target_variable'` with the actual name of the target variable in the dataset, and ensure that the mock data file at `data_file_path` contains the necessary features and target variable for training the model.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

def complex_deep_learning_algorithm(data_file_path):
    # Load mock data
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Preprocessing and feature engineering
    X = data.drop('target_variable', axis=1).values
    y = data['target_variable'].values

    # Data normalization
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X = scaler.fit_transform(X)

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Define the deep learning model architecture
    model = Sequential([
        Dense(64, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],), activation='relu'),
        Dropout(0.5),
        Dense(32, activation='relu'),
        Dropout(0.3),
        Dense(1)
    ])

    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    # Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Calculate mean squared error
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")

    # Return the trained deep learning model for deployment
    return model
```

In this function, the `complex_deep_learning_algorithm` takes a file path for the mock data as input. It loads the data, performs preprocessing and feature engineering, normalizes the data, splits it into training and testing sets, defines a deep learning model using Keras, compiles and trains the model, makes predictions, and evaluates the model using mean squared error. Finally, it returns the trained deep learning model for deployment.

As with the previous function, ensure that the mock data file at `data_file_path` contains the necessary features and target variable for training the deep learning model.
