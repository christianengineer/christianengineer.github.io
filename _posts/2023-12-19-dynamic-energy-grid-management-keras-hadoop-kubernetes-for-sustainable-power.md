### Model Training and Deployment

- **Keras and TensorFlow**: Using Keras for building and training machine learning models, and integrating with TensorFlow for efficient computation and model serving.
- **Model Versioning**: Employing tools like MLflow or DVC for managing model versions, tracking experiments, and reproducing model runs.
- **Model Serving**: Using TensorFlow Serving or TensorFlow Extended (TFX) for serving trained models within Kubernetes clusters.

### Scalable Infrastructure

- **Kubernetes**: Utilizing Kubernetes for container orchestration to ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient resource utilization for model deployment and serving.
- **Hadoop**: Leveraging Hadoop for distributed storage and processing of large-scale energy data and model training datasets.

### Monitoring and Feedback Loop

- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implementing centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack) and monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for tracking model performance, system metrics, and resource utilization.
- **Feedback Loop**: Incorporating feedback loops to retrain and update models based on real-time data and performance metrics.

## Workflow Automation

Below is an example of a Python script for training a machine learning model for energy demand prediction in the context of the Dynamic Energy Grid Management application. The script utilizes mock data for demonstration purposes. It is essential to note that in a real-world scenario, actual energy consumption data and relevant features would be used for training the model.

```python
## File Path: dynamic-energy-grid-management/src/machine_learning/train_demand_prediction_model.py

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.optimizers import Adam
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

## Load mock energy consumption data
data = {
    'temperature': np.random.randint(60, 100, size=1000),
    'day_of_week': np.random.randint(0, 7, size=1000),
    'hour_of_day': np.random.randint(0, 24, size=1000),
    'holiday': np.random.randint(0, 2, size=1000),
    'energy_consumption': np.random.randint(1000, 5000, size=1000)
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

## Prepare input features and target variable
X = df[['temperature', 'day_of_week', 'hour_of_day', 'holiday']]
y = df['energy_consumption']

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Define the neural network model for energy demand prediction
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, input_shape=(4,), activation='relu'),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1)  ## Output layer
])

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss='mean_squared_error')

## Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

## Save the trained model and its architecture
model.save('energy_demand_prediction_model.h5')
model_json = model.to_json()
with open("energy_demand_prediction_model.json", "w") as json_file:
    json_file.write(model_json)

## Save the model metadata
metadata = {
    'input_features': ['temperature', 'day_of_week', 'hour_of_day', 'holiday'],
    'output_variable': 'energy_consumption',
    'training_samples': len(X_train),
    'testing_samples': len(X_test)
}
with open('energy_demand_prediction_model_metadata.yaml', 'w') as file:
    yaml.dump(metadata, file)
```

In this example, the file `train_demand_prediction_model.py` is located within the `src/machine_learning/` directory of the Dynamic Energy Grid Management repository. The script generates mock data for energy consumption, prepares the input features and target variable, creates a neural network model using Keras, trains the model, and saves the trained model, its architecture, and metadata.

Please note that in a production environment, real data would be used for training, and additional preprocessing and validation steps would typically be incorporated.

In the context of the Dynamic Energy Grid Management application, a complex machine learning algorithm such as a deep neural network for renewable energy production forecasting represents a critical component. Below is an example of a Python script using Keras for training a deep learning model for renewable energy production forecasting, utilizing mock data for demonstration purposes.

```python
## File Path: dynamic-energy-grid-management/src/machine_learning/train_renewable_energy_forecasting_model.py

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from keras.optimizers import Adam
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

## Load mock renewable energy production data
## Generating mock data for demonstration purposes
## Replace with actual renewable energy production data in a real-world scenario
time_steps = 1000
num_features = 5
X = np.random.rand(time_steps, num_features)  ## Mock input features
y = np.random.rand(time_steps, 1)  ## Mock target variable

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Define the LSTM neural network model for renewable energy production forecasting
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(64, input_shape=(num_features, 1), return_sequences=True),
    LSTM(32, return_sequences=False),
    Dense(1)  ## Output layer
])

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss='mean_squared_error')

## Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

## Save the trained model and its architecture
model.save('renewable_energy_forecasting_model.h5')
model_json = model.to_json()
with open("renewable_energy_forecasting_model.json", "w") as json_file:
    json_file.write(model_json)

## Save the model metadata
metadata = {
    'input_features': num_features,
    'output_variable': 'renewable_energy_production',
    'training_samples': len(X_train),
    'testing_samples': len(X_test)
}
with open('renewable_energy_forecasting_model_metadata.yaml', 'w') as file:
    yaml.dump(metadata, file)
```

In this example, the file `train_renewable_energy_forecasting_model.py` is located within the `src/machine_learning/` directory of the Dynamic Energy Grid Management repository. The script uses Keras to define and train a deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for renewable energy production forecasting, using mock data for demonstration purposes.

Please note that in a real-world scenario, actual renewable energy production data would be used for training the model, and comprehensive preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and validation procedures would be integral parts of the model development process.
