Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a machine learning model for the Mobile App Personalization using TensorFlow Lite application. This script utilizes mock data for demonstration purposes.

### File: `models/training/train_model.py`

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.svm import SVC
import joblib

## Load mock data (Replace with actual data loading and preprocessing steps)
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_mock_data.csv')

## Preprocessing mock data (Replace with actual data preprocessing steps)
X = data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']].values
y = data['target'].values
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

## Model training (Replace with actual model training code)
model = SVC(kernel='rbf', C=1.0, gamma='scale')
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Evaluate the model
train_accuracy = model.score(X_train, y_train)
test_accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Training Accuracy: {train_accuracy:.2f}, Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy:.2f}')

## Save the trained model in TensorFlow Lite format
tflite_model_file = 'models/training/personalization_model.tflite'
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_sklearn(model)
tflite_model = converter.convert()
with open(tflite_model_file, 'wb') as f:
    f.write(tflite_model)

## Save the scaler for future inference
scaler_file = 'models/training/scaler.pkl'
joblib.dump(scaler, scaler_file)
```

This script demonstrates a simplified training process using mock data, including data loading, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and conversion of the trained model to TensorFlow Lite format. In a real-world scenario, actual data and models specific to the Personalization application would be used, and the training process would be more extensive.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script demonstrating a more complex machine learning algorithm, specifically a deep learning model using TensorFlow, for the Mobile App Personalization using TensorFlow Lite application. This script utilizes mock data for demonstration purposes.

### File: `models/training/train_complex_model.py`

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

## Load mock data (Replace with actual data loading and preprocessing steps)
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_mock_data.csv')

## Preprocessing mock data (Replace with actual data preprocessing steps)
X = data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']].values
y = data['target'].values
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

## Define complex deep learning model
model = Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), verbose=2)

## Evaluate the model
train_loss, train_accuracy = model.evaluate(X_train, y_train, verbose=0)
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f'Training Accuracy: {train_accuracy:.2f}, Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy:.2f}')

## Save the trained model in TensorFlow Lite format
tflite_model_file = 'models/training/complex_personalization_model.tflite'
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
tflite_model = converter.convert()
with open(tflite_model_file, 'wb') as f:
    f.write(tflite_model)

## Save the scaler for future inference
scaler_file = 'models/training/scaler.pkl'
joblib.dump(scaler, scaler_file)
```

In this script, a more complex deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras is defined, trained, and then converted to the TensorFlow Lite format for deployment within the Mobile App Personalization application. This demonstrates a more advanced machine learning algorithm using mock data, with the potential for more extensive model architecture and tuning in a real-world scenario.
