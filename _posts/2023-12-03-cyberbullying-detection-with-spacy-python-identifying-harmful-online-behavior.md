## Objectives

The primary objectives of the AI Cyberbullying Detection with SpaCy project are to build a scalable and accurate system for identifying harmful online behavior, particularly cyberbullying. The system aims to leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text data from online sources, detect instances of cyberbullying, and classify them appropriately. The project intends to utilize the SpaCy library for NLP tasks and implement machine learning models to improve detection accuracy.

## System Design Strategies

2. Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data to remove noise, perform tokenization, and handle text normalization.
3. Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the text data and create representations suitable for machine learning models.
4. Model Development: Train machine learning models using the processed text data to classify instances of cyberbullying or harmful behavior.
5. Integration: Deploy the trained models into a scalable and accessible system, enabling real-time or batch processing of text data to identify cyberbullying instances.
