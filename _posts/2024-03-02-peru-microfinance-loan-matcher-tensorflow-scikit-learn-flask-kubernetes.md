I will create a Python script for training a decision tree model using mock data for the Peru Microfinance Loan Matcher application. The file will be saved as `train_model.py` in the `models/` directory.

```python
# models/train_model.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from joblib import dump

# Load mock data (replace with actual data loading logic)
data = {
    'income': [2500, 3000, 2000, 1500, 3500],
    'savings': [1000, 500, 200, 300, 150],
    'loan_amount': [500, 1000, 800, 600, 1200],
    'approved_loan': [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]  # 1: Yes, 0: No
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Prepare features and target variable
X = df[['income', 'savings', 'loan_amount']]
y = df['approved_loan']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train Decision Tree model
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Save the trained model
model_path = 'model_selection/decision_tree_model.pkl'
dump(model, model_path)

print(f"Decision Tree model trained and saved at: {model_path}")
```

This script loads mock data, trains a decision tree model using Scikit-Learn, and saves the trained model using joblib. You can run this script to train the model with mock data for the AI Peru Microfinance Loan Matcher application.

I will create a Python script for training a neural network model using mock data for the Peru Microfinance Loan Matcher application. The file will be saved as `train_neural_network.py` in the `models/` directory.

```python
# models/train_neural_network.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from joblib import dump

# Load mock data (replace with actual data loading logic)
data = {
    'income': [2500, 3000, 2000, 1500, 3500],
    'savings': [1000, 500, 200, 300, 150],
    'loan_amount': [500, 1000, 800, 600, 1200],
    'approved_loan': [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]  # 1: Yes, 0: No
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Prepare features and target variable
X = df[['income', 'savings', 'loan_amount']]
y = df['approved_loan']

# Normalize features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train Neural Network model
model = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(100, 50), activation='relu', max_iter=1000)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Save the trained model
model_path = 'model_selection/neural_network_model.joblib'
dump(model, model_path)

print(f"Neural Network model trained and saved at: {model_path}")
```

This script loads mock data, preprocesses it by normalizing the features, trains a neural network model using Scikit-Learn, and saves the trained model using joblib. You can run this script to train a neural network model with mock data for the AI Peru Microfinance Loan Matcher application.
