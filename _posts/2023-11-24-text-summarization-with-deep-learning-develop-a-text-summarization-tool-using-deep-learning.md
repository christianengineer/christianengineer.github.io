Sure, below is a Python function that represents a complex machine learning algorithm for text summarization using a deep learning model. This function uses mock data and saves the summarization results to a file.

```python
import os

def text_summarization_with_deep_learning(input_text):
    # Replace this with actual deep learning model for text summarization
    mock_summary = "This is a mock summary of the input text. It demonstrates the summarization result using deep learning."

    # Create a directory for results if it does not exist
    results_directory = 'results'
    if not os.path.exists(results_directory):
        os.makedirs(results_directory)

    # Define file path for saving the summarization result
    result_file_path = os.path.join(results_directory, 'summarized_text.txt')

    # Save the summarization result to a file
    with open(result_file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(mock_summary)

    return result_file_path
```

In this function:
- The `text_summarization_with_deep_learning` function takes `input_text` as a parameter.
- For illustration purposes, a mock summary is generated using a placeholder deep learning model. This should be replaced with the actual implementation using deep learning models such as Transformers, LSTM, or BERT for text summarization.
- It creates a directory named 'results' if it does not exist, to store the summarization results.
- The summarization result is saved to a file named `summarized_text.txt` within the 'results' directory.
- Finally, the function returns the file path of the saved summarization result.

You can call this function by passing input text as an argument and it will return the file path where the summarization result is saved. Remember to replace the mock summarization logic with the actual implementation using deep learning models for text summarization.

Certainly! Below is a Python function that represents a complex deep learning algorithm for text summarization. This function uses a deep learning model to generate a summary for the input text and saves the summarization results to a file.

```python
import os

def deep_learning_text_summarization(input_text):
    # Replace this with actual deep learning model for text summarization
    # Here, we use a placeholder function to generate a mock summary
    def placeholder_deep_learning_model(input_text):
        # Placeholder logic for generating a mock summary
        mock_summary = "This is a mock summary of the input text using a deep learning model."
        return mock_summary

    # Generate summary using the deep learning model
    summary = placeholder_deep_learning_model(input_text)

    # Create a directory for results if it does not exist
    results_directory = 'results'
    if not os.path.exists(results_directory):
        os.makedirs(results_directory)

    # Define file path for saving the summarization result
    result_file_path = os.path.join(results_directory, 'summarized_text.txt')

    # Save the summarization result to a file
    with open(result_file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(summary)

    return result_file_path
```

In this function:
- The `deep_learning_text_summarization` function takes `input_text` as a parameter.
- Inside the function, a placeholder deep learning model `placeholder_deep_learning_model` is used to generate a mock summary for the input text. This placeholder function should be replaced with the actual implementation using deep learning models (e.g., Transformer-based models like BERT or T5, LSTM, or other deep learning architectures for text summarization).
- It creates a directory named 'results' if it does not exist, to store the summarization results.
- The summarization result is saved to a file named `summarized_text.txt` within the 'results' directory.
- Finally, the function returns the file path of the saved summarization result.

You can call this function by passing input text as an argument, and it will return the file path where the summarization result is saved. Remember to replace the placeholder deep learning model with the actual deep learning model for text summarization.
