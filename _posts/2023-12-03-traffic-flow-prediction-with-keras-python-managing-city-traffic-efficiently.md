```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

def train_traffic_flow_prediction_model(data_file_path, model_save_path):
    ## Load mock traffic data from file
    traffic_data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Preprocess the data (e.g., scaling, feature engineering)
    ## ...

    ## Define input features and target variable
    X = traffic_data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']].values
    y = traffic_data['target'].values

    ## Define and configure the deep learning model
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(LSTM(100, activation='relu', input_shape=(X.shape[1], X.shape[2])))
    model.add(Dense(1))
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

    ## Save the trained model
    model.save(model_save_path)

## Example usage
data_file_path = 'data/processed_data/train/traffic_data.csv'
model_save_path = 'models/trained_models/traffic_flow_model.h5'
train_traffic_flow_prediction_model(data_file_path, model_save_path)
```

In this code snippet:
- The `train_traffic_flow_prediction_model` function takes the file path of mock traffic data (`data_file_path`) and the desired location to save the trained model (`model_save_path`) as input parameters.
- Within the function, the mock traffic data is loaded from the specified file path, preprocessed, and split into input features (X) and the target variable (y).
- A complex machine learning algorithm using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network is defined and configured for traffic flow prediction, using Keras as the deep learning framework.
- The function trains the model on the preprocessed traffic data and saves the trained model to the specified `model_save_path`.
- Finally, an example usage demonstrates how to call the function with the file paths for the mock data file and the desired model save location.

This function encapsulates the process of training a complex machine learning algorithm for traffic flow prediction using Keras and can be integrated into the Traffic Flow Prediction with Keras application for real-world data.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

def train_traffic_flow_prediction_model(data_file_path, model_save_path):
    ## Load mock traffic data from file
    traffic_data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Preprocess the data (e.g., scaling, feature engineering)
    ## ...

    ## Define input features and target variable
    X = traffic_data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']].values
    y = traffic_data['target'].values

    ## Reshape input features for LSTM input
    X = X.reshape((X.shape[0], 1, X.shape[1]))

    ## Define and configure the deep learning model
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(LSTM(100, activation='relu', input_shape=(X.shape[1], X.shape[2])))
    model.add(Dense(1))

    ## Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

    ## Save the trained model
    model.save(model_save_path)

## Example usage
data_file_path = 'data/processed_data/traffic_data.csv'
model_save_path = 'models/trained_models/traffic_flow_model.h5'
train_traffic_flow_prediction_model(data_file_path, model_save_path)
```

In the above Python function:
- The `train_traffic_flow_prediction_model` function takes the file path of mock traffic data (`data_file_path`) and the desired location to save the trained model (`model_save_path`) as input parameters.
- The function loads the mock traffic data from the specified file path using pandas.
- The data preprocessing steps and data feature extraction are performed (placeholder comments indicate the required preprocessing steps).
- The input features `X` and the target variable `y` are extracted from the traffic data.
- The input features are reshaped to be compatible with the LSTM model input requirements.
- A Sequential Keras model with an LSTM layer and a Dense output layer is defined and compiled with the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error loss function.
- The model is trained on the preprocessed traffic data and saved to the specified `model_save_path`.
- An example usage demonstrates how to call the function with the file paths for the mock data file and the desired model save location.

This function encapsulates the process of training a complex machine learning algorithm for traffic flow prediction using Keras and can be integrated into the Traffic Flow Prediction with Keras application for real-world data.
