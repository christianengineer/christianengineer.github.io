# Predictive Maintenance Tool for Manufacturing Repository

## Description

This GitHub repository is dedicated to the Predictive Maintenance Tool for Manufacturing. Our tool is designed to assist manufacturers in predicting possible equipment failures and any needed maintenance before any costly downtime occurs. This is achieved by analyzing equipment performance data against various metrics that might indicate a possible breakdown. This way, you can address potential issues before they become substantial problems.

The tool brings together a combination of advanced analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. With these technologies, manufacturers can take a proactive and predictive approach to equipment maintenance, improving the overall availability and reliability of the equipment while reducing maintenance costs and mitigating the risk of unplanned downtime.

## Goals

1. **Predictive Analysis**: We aim to develop an advanced predictive analytics system that can accurately predict equipment maintenance requirements.
2. **Reduce Downtime**: By predicting maintenance needs ahead of time, we can significantly reduce equipment downtime.
3. **Increase Efficiency**: With predictive maintenance, we aim to improve overall manufacturing efficiency.
4. **Cost Saving**: Reducing unscheduled equipment downtime and increasing efficiency will lead to significant cost savings.

## Libraries and Technologies

To achieve efficient data handling, accurate predictions, and scalable user traffic, the following libraries and technologies will be utilized:

1. **Pandas**: This library provides powerful data structures and data analysis tools for Python, which will be used for efficient data handling.
2. **NumPy**: Essential for numerical computing in Python, NumPy offers robust high-level mathematical functions.
3. **Scikit-Learn**: This library offers a variety of machine learning algorithms to develop our predictive models.
4. **TensorFlow and Keras**: These powerful libraries will be utilized for deep learning models.
5. **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: These libraries will be used for data visualization.
6. **Flask**: We will use this lightweight web-server framework for creating our user-interface and managing user traffic.
7. **Docker**: This technology will be used to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers - allowing for scalability and ensuring our application runs the same regardless of the environment.
8. **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: For both data storage and cloud computing, this platformâ€™s scalability will ensure high availability and performance.

With commitment to continued enhancement, this Predictive Maintenance Tool aims to be among the leading predictive maintenance solutions, offering advanced and accurate machinery monitoring and evaluation tools to manufacturers.

# Predictive Maintenance Tool for Manufacturing

## File Structure

This is a demonstration of a fictitious Python file that would handle the logic for the Predictive Maintenance Tool. The filename is `predictiveModel.py` under the folder `src/analysis`.

```python
# src/analysis/predictiveModel.py

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn import metrics
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
import joblib

class PredictiveModel:

    def __init__(self, data_file):
        self.df = pd.read_csv(data_file)
        self.model = None

    def preprocess(self):
        """Preprocessing steps like cleaning and transforming go here."""
        # For instance, fill missing values
        self.df = self.df.fillna(method='ffill')

    def train(self):
        """Split the data and train the model."""
        # Split the data
        X = self.df.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
        y = self.df['target_variable']
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

        # Train the model
        self.model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
        self.model.fit(X_train, y_train)

        # Make predictions and calculate accuracy
        y_pred = self.model.predict(X_test)
        accuracy = metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
        print(f'Model Accuracy: {accuracy}')

    def save(self, model_file):
        """Save the trained model."""
        joblib.dump(self.model, model_file)

    def load(self, model_file):
        """Load a pre-trained model."""
        self.model = joblib.load(model_file)

    def predict(self, input_data):
        """Predict the maintenance needs based on the input data."""
        prediction = self.model.predict(input_data)
        return prediction
```
````

This file is kept minimal for the sake of example. `Preprocess`, `train`, `save`, `load` and `predict` are methods that are expected in a machine learning pipeline. Exact methods and their implementations can vary based on the actual data and requirements.
