```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def complex_machine_learning_algorithm(data_path):
    ## Load mock data from the specified file path
    data = np.load(data_path)

    ## Preprocess the data if necessary
    preprocessed_data = preprocess_data(data)

    ## Define the TensorFlow model architecture
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
        tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
    ])

    ## Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
                  metrics=['accuracy'])

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(preprocessed_data, epochs=10)

    ## Return the trained model
    return model

def preprocess_data(data):
    ## Perform data preprocessing such as normalization, reshaping, etc.
    preprocessed_data = data / 255.0  ## For example, normalize pixel values

    return preprocessed_data
```

In this example, the `complex_machine_learning_algorithm` function takes a file path as input to load mock data, preprocesses the data if necessary, defines a complex TensorFlow model architecture, compiles the model, trains the model using the preprocessed data, and returns the trained model. Additionally, a `preprocess_data` function is included to demonstrate data preprocessing steps such as normalization. This function can be used as a part of the end-to-end pipeline for developing complex machine learning algorithms for self-driving car applications using TensorFlow and Python.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def complex_machine_learning_algorithm(data_path):
    ## Load mock data from the specified file path
    data = np.load(data_path)

    ## Preprocess the data if necessary
    preprocessed_data = preprocess_data(data)

    ## Define the TensorFlow model architecture
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
        tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)
    ])

    ## Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
                  metrics=['accuracy'])

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(preprocessed_data, epochs=10)

    ## Return the trained model
    return model

def preprocess_data(data):
    ## TODO: Implement data preprocessing steps such as normalization, reshaping, etc.
    preprocessed_data = data  ## Placeholder for data preprocessing

    return preprocessed_data
```

In this example, the `complex_machine_learning_algorithm` function takes a file path as input to load mock data, preprocesses the data if necessary, defines a complex TensorFlow model architecture, compiles the model, trains the model using the preprocessed data, and returns the trained model. Additionally, a `preprocess_data` function is included as a placeholder to demonstrate the need for data preprocessing steps such as normalization, reshaping, etc. This function can be tailored to specific preprocessing requirements for the self-driving car algorithms application.
