```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def complex_machine_learning_algorithm(data_file_path):
    # Load mock data from file
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Preprocessing and feature engineering
    # ...

    # Split data into features and target variable
    X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = data['target']

    # Split data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize and train a complex machine learning algorithm (e.g., Random Forest)
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions on the test set
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)

    return model, accuracy
```

In this function, `complex_machine_learning_algorithm`, the mock data is loaded from a specified file path using `pd.read_csv`. The data is then preprocessed and split into features and target variables. A complex machine learning algorithm (Random Forest classifier in this case) is initialized, trained on the training data, and used to make predictions on the test set. Finally, the accuracy of the model is computed and returned as an output along with the trained model itself.

The `data_file_path` parameter represents the file path where the mock data is stored, and it should be provided as an argument when calling the function. For example:
```python
file_path = 'path_to_mock_data.csv'
trained_model, accuracy = complex_machine_learning_algorithm(file_path)
```
Please replace `'path_to_mock_data.csv'` with the actual file path to the mock data CSV file.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

def complex_deep_learning_algorithm(data_file_path):
    # Load mock data from file
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Preprocessing and feature engineering
    # ...

    # Split data into features and target variable
    X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = data['target']

    # Split data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize a deep learning model
    model = Sequential([
        Dense(64, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],), activation='relu'),
        Dropout(0.5),
        Dense(32, activation='relu'),
        Dropout(0.3),
        Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=64, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    # Evaluate the model
    _, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
    
    return model, accuracy
```

In this function, `complex_deep_learning_algorithm`, the mock data is loaded from a specified file path using `pd.read_csv`. The data is then preprocessed and split into features and target variables. A complex deep learning model is initialized using Keras Sequential API, and it consists of multiple fully connected layers with dropout regularization. The model is compiled with an optimizer, loss function, and accuracy metric, and then trained on the training data. Finally, the accuracy of the model is computed and returned as an output along with the trained model itself.

The `data_file_path` parameter represents the file path where the mock data is stored, and it should be provided as an argument when calling the function. For example:
```python
file_path = 'path_to_mock_data.csv'
trained_model, accuracy = complex_deep_learning_algorithm(file_path)
```
Please replace `'path_to_mock_data.csv'` with the actual file path to the mock data CSV file.
