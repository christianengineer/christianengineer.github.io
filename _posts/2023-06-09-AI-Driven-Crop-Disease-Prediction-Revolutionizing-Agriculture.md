# AI-Based Crop Disease Prediction App

**Description:**

The AI-Based Crop Disease Prediction App is developed to recognize crop disease through image identification. The ultimate goal of the app is to facilitate early detection of crop diseases and provide swift mitigation strategies, consequently aiding farmers in safeguarding their crops. The application works by analyzing input images and identifying the potential diseases affecting the crops. 

The project uses advanced AI and Machine Learning models to analyze and classify images based on training and testing datasets. The app consists of a user-friendly front-end and a powerful back-end that processes the image and returns the analysis in a simple and comprehensive way.

**Goals:**

- To facilitate early identification of crop diseases to mitigate loss.
- Improving the decision-making process for farmers, agricultural consultants, and other relevant field players.
- Implement accurate machine learning and AI techniques for disease prediction.
- Scaling the app to handle high amounts of traffic and large datasets.

**Technologies and Libraries:**

**Data Handling:**

- **NumPy:** A library used for numerical computation, to handle large, multi-dimensional arrays, and matrices of numeric data.
- **Pandas:** A data manipulation and analysis tool, which is used to manage and organize datasets.
- **SciKit-Learn:** It is used for machine learning, including the implementation and handling of various algorithms such as classification, regression, and clustering.

**Image Processing:**

- **OpenCV:** An open-source computer vision and machine learning software library, primarily used for image processing in the classification of diseases.
- **Matplotlib:** Used for data visualization in form of graphs and charts to better understand the patterns and outliers.

**AI and Machine Learning:**

- **TensorFlow:** A robust, end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning used for building and training deep learning models.
- **Keras:** Makes use of TensorFlow's core functions and simplifies the process of building and training deep learning models. It's user-friendly, flexible and lets us experiment with different models.

**Scalable User Traffic:**

- **Node.js:** To deal with concurrent requests and manage multiple connections simultaneously.
- **Express.js:** A Node.js framework which is used to build APIs for the app and handle HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL Database used to store user data and is more flexible in dealing with unstructured data.
- **Nginx/Apache server:** For better request handling and balancing the load, making the app capable of handling higher traffic.

It's crucial to note that maintaining security, performance efficiency, and data privacy will remain at the top on our agenda while employing these technologies.
  
**Backend Language:**

- **Python:** It is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose dynamic programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java.

**Frontend Technologies:**

- **ReactJS:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux:** A predictable state container designed to help you write JavaScript apps that behave consistently across client, server, and native environments.
- **Bootstrap:** It is a CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.

This combination of technologies and libraries is what makes our crop disease prediction platform a highly effective, reliable, and scalable tool.

Below is a suggested file structure for your AI-based Crop Disease Prediction App repository:

**Explanation:**

- The **app** directory contains the core application code.
    - **main.py** is the entry point of the application.
    - The **api** directory contains the route definitions and utilities for the API.
    - The **models** directory contains the machine learning model used for predictions.
    - The **static** folder serves static files like CSS and JavaScript.
    - The **templates** directory consists of templates for rendering frontend views.
- The **test** directory contains all unit tests for the application.
- The **data** directory consists of datasets for training and testing the prediction model.
- The **node_modules** directory contains all the project dependencies.
- **env**: It is used to keep all the environment variables which are ought to be kept secret, such as database passwords, secret key etc.
- **.gitignore** specifies the files types to be ignored during the commit process.
- **README.md** for project documentation.
- **package.json** and **package-lock.json** handle the project's npm dependencies.
- **requirements.txt** contains the Python dependencies that can be installed using pip.

Here's a simple example of a Python file that might handle some of the logic for an AI-Based Crop Disease Prediction App. This file is just a boilerplate and does not include the actual implementation details. Let's call this file `disease_predictor.py` and let's place it in the `app/api/utilities/` directory.

`app/api/utilities/disease_predictor.py`:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

class DiseasePredictor:
  
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = load_model('../../models/prediction_model.h5')
        self.class_labels = LabelEncoder()
        self.class_labels.classes_ = np.load('../../models/class_labels.npy')

    def preprocess_image(self, img_path):
        """This function receives an image path, opens the image and preprocesses it for the model."""
        img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(64, 64))
        x = image.img_to_array(img)
        x = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)
        img_data = preprocess_input(x)
        return img_data

    def predict_disease(self, img_path):
        """Predict the disease in the given image."""
        img_data = self.preprocess_image(img_path)
        preds = self.model.predict(img_data)
        pred_class = np.argmax(preds, axis=1)
        pred_label = self.class_labels.inverse_transform(pred_class)
        return pred_label[0]

```

**Explanation:**

- The `DiseasePredictor` class encapsulates the prediction model and the methods associated with it.
- `__init__()`: Initializes the model and load classes of the model from a saved file.
- `preprocess_image(img_path)`: Opens and preprocesses the image to be processed by the model.
- `predict_disease(img_path)`: Returns the prediction of the disease of the given image.
