Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a PyTorch model for the Real-time Social Media Trend Analysis application using mock data. The script leverages PyTorch for model training and Spark for data preprocessing. The mock data is used for demonstration purposes.

```python
# File: model_training.py
# Path: real-time-social-media-trend-analysis/model_training/pytorch/model_training.py

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
import torch.utils.data as data_utils

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("MockDataProcessing").getOrCreate()

# Mock data preprocessing using Spark
# Assume data is loaded from a source and preprocessed using Spark DataFrame operations
# For demonstration, let's assume we have a preprocessed Spark DataFrame 'processed_data'
processed_data = spark.read.csv("mock_data.csv", header=True)

# Perform feature extraction, normalization, and preparation
# ...

# Convert the preprocessed data to a Pandas dataframe for PyTorch model training
processed_df = processed_data.toPandas()

# Assuming we have input features X and target variable y
X = torch.tensor(processed_df.iloc[:, :-1].values, dtype=torch.float32)
y = torch.tensor(processed_df.iloc[:, -1].values, dtype=torch.long)

# Define the PyTorch model
class TrendAnalysisModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super(TrendAnalysisModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Instantiate the model
input_dim = X.shape[1]
hidden_dim = 32
output_dim = 2  # Assuming a binary classification task
model = TrendAnalysisModel(input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim)

# Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Create a PyTorch dataset and dataloader
dataset = data_utils.TensorDataset(X, y)
dataloader = data_utils.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Train the model
num_epochs = 10
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    running_loss = 0.0
    for i, data in enumerate(dataloader, 0):
        inputs, labels = data
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        running_loss += loss.item()

    print(f"Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {running_loss/len(dataloader)}")

# Save the trained model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "trained_model.pth")
```

        outputs = torch.stack([model(x) for model in self.base_models], dim=2)
        aggregated_output = torch.mean(outputs, dim=2)
        return aggregated_output

# Define the base model architecture
class BaseModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super(BaseModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)

    def forward(self, x):

y = torch.tensor(processed_df.iloc[:, -1].values, dtype=torch.long)

# Instantiate the ensemble model
input_dim = X.shape[1]
hidden_dim = 64
output_dim = 2  # Assuming a binary classification task
num_base_models = 3
ensemble_model = EnsembleModel(input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim, num_base_models)

# Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(ensemble_model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Create a PyTorch dataset and dataloader
dataset = data_utils.TensorDataset(X, y)
dataloader = data_utils.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Train the ensemble model
num_epochs = 10
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    running_loss = 0.0
    for i, data in enumerate(dataloader, 0):
        inputs, labels = data
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = ensemble_model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        running_loss += loss.item()

    print(f"Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {running_loss/len(dataloader)}")

# Save the trained ensemble model
torch.save(ensemble_model.state_dict(), "trained_ensemble_model.pth")
```

In this example, the script `complex_model_training.py` is located at `real-time-social-media-trend-analysis/model_training/pytorch/` within the project's file structure.
