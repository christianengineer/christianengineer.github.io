Sure, below is a Python function for a complex machine learning algorithm that uses mock data. This function is a hypothetical example and does not represent an actual algorithm used in genomic studies. The function performs data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using scikit-learn for genomic data classification.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

def train_genomic_classification_model(data_file_path):
    # Load mock genomic data from a file
    genomic_data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Preprocessing: Separate features and target variable
    X = genomic_data.drop('target_label', axis=1)
    y = genomic_data['target_label']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize and train the RandomForestClassifier
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

    return model, accuracy, report
```

In this example, the `train_genomic_classification_model` function takes a file path as input (`data_file_path`) where the mock genomic data is stored. The function then performs the following steps:

1. Loads the genomic data from the specified file using pandas.
2. Preprocesses the data by separating features and the target variable.
3. Splits the data into training and testing sets.
4. Initializes and trains a Random Forest classifier using scikit-learn.
5. Makes predictions on the test set and evaluates the model's performance.

You can use this function as a starting point for developing more complex machine learning algorithms for genomic data classification within the GeneAI AI in Genomic Studies application.

Certainly! Below is a hypothetical Python function for a complex deep learning algorithm using TensorFlow for genomic data analysis. This function is a mock example and does not represent a specific algorithm used in genomic studies.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

def train_deep_learning_genomic_model(data_file_path):
    # Load mock genomic data from a file
    genomic_data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Preprocessing: Separate features and target variable, and scale the features
    X = genomic_data.drop('target_label', axis=1).values
    y = genomic_data['target_label'].values
    X = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Build a deep learning model using TensorFlow's Keras API
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],), activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='binary_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    return model
```

In this example, the `train_deep_learning_genomic_model` function takes a file path as input (`data_file_path`) where the mock genomic data is stored, and it performs the following steps:

1. Loads the genomic data from the specified file using pandas.
2. Preprocesses the data by separating features and the target variable, and scales the features using StandardScaler.
3. Splits the data into training and testing sets.
4. Builds a deep learning model using TensorFlow's Keras API with two hidden layers and dropout regularization.
5. Compiles and trains the model using the training data.

This function provides a hypothetical example of a deep learning algorithm for genomic data analysis within the GeneAI AI in Genomic Studies application, using TensorFlow.
