### File: `train_model.py`

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import numpy as np

# Create mock data for training
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 5)  # Mock feature data with 5 input features
y_train = np.random.rand(100, 1)   # Mock target data

# Define the TensorFlow model architecture
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1)  # Output layer for predicting agrochemical usage
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the model with mock data
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Save the trained model
model.save('models/tensorflow/optimized_agrochemical_model')

print("Model training completed and saved.")
```

### File Path: `train_model.py`

The file `train_model.py` should be placed in the root directory of the project, alongside the `data`, `models`, and `deployment` directories.

By running this script, a TensorFlow model for the Peru Agrochemical Usage Optimization Model will be trained using mock data. The trained model will then be saved in the `models/tensorflow/` directory with the name `optimized_agrochemical_model`.

I will provide a Python script for implementing a complex machine learning algorithm using TensorFlow and Keras for the Peru Agrochemical Usage Optimization Model. This script will demonstrate a more advanced model architecture and training procedure with mock data.

### File: `complex_ml_algorithm.py`

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import numpy as np

# Create mock data for training
X_train = np.random.rand(1000, 10)  # Mock feature data with 10 input features
y_train = np.random.rand(1000, 1)   # Mock target data
