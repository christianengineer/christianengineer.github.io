import pandas as pd

## Load preprocessed data
df = pd.read_csv('data/processed/preprocessed_data.csv')
X = df.drop(columns=['target_column'])
y = df['target_column']

## Split the data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Define the model architecture
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    Dropout(0.2),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.2),

    ## Model prediction
    prediction = model.predict(input_data)
    ## Post-processing (e.g., converting predictions to human-readable format)
    processed_prediction = postprocess_prediction(prediction)
    return jsonify({'prediction': processed_prediction})

def preprocess_input(data):
    ## Perform data preprocessing specific to the model's input requirements
    ## E.g., feature normalization, conversion to model input format
    preprocessed_data = np.array([data['feature1'], data['feature2']])
    return preprocessed_data
