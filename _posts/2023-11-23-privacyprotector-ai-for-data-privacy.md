```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def train_privacy_preserving_model(data_file_path):
    ## Load mock data from file
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Preprocessing
    X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = data['target']

    ## Split data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Initialize and train a privacy-preserving machine learning model
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    ## Evaluate the model
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    return model, accuracy

## Example usage
mock_data_file_path = 'mock_data.csv'
trained_model, accuracy = train_privacy_preserving_model(mock_data_file_path)
print(f"Trained model accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

In this example, the `train_privacy_preserving_model` function takes a file path as input, loads mock data from the specified file, preprocesses the data, trains a privacy-preserving machine learning model (Random Forest in this case), evaluates the model's accuracy, and returns the trained model and its accuracy. This function demonstrates the process of training a privacy-preserving machine learning model using mock data.

Mock data file ('mock_data.csv') should contain the features along with the target variable for training the model.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def train_privacy_preserving_deep_learning_model(data_file_path):
    ## Load mock data from file
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Preprocessing
    X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = data['target']

    ## Split data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Feature scaling
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

    ## Build the deep learning model
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

    ## Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    ## Evaluate the model
    y_pred = (model.predict(X_test) > 0.5).astype("int32")
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    return model, accuracy

## Example usage
mock_data_file_path = 'mock_data.csv'
trained_model, accuracy = train_privacy_preserving_deep_learning_model(mock_data_file_path)
print(f"Trained deep learning model accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

In this example, the `train_privacy_preserving_deep_learning_model` function takes a file path as input, loads mock data from the specified file, preprocesses the data, builds and trains a privacy-preserving deep learning model using TensorFlow, evaluates the model's accuracy, and returns the trained model and its accuracy. The function demonstrates the process of training a privacy-preserving deep learning model using mock data.

Mock data file ('mock_data.csv') should contain the features along with the target variable for training the model.
