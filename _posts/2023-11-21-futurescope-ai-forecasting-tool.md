Certainly! Below is a Python function for a complex machine learning algorithm that utilizes mock data. This function represents a simplified example of a machine learning model that could be used within the FutureScope - AI Forecasting Tool application. For demonstration purposes, let's assume we are creating a function to train a deep learning model for time series forecasting using TensorFlow.

```python
## File Path: future_scope_ai_forecasting_tool/ai/models/model_architecture.py

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

def train_lstm_forecasting_model(data):
    """
    Train a LSTM-based forecasting model using mock data.

    Args:
    - data: A numpy array of mock time series data (e.g., historical stock prices, weather patterns).

    Returns:
    - trained_model: The trained LSTM forecasting model
    """

    ## Preprocess the data (assuming univariate time series)
    scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))
    scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data.reshape(-1, 1))

    ## Prepare the data for training
    def create_dataset(data, time_steps):
        X, y = [], []
        for i in range(len(data) - time_steps):
            X.append(data[i:(i + time_steps), 0])
            y.append(data[i + time_steps, 0])
        return np.array(X), np.array(y)

    time_steps = 10
    X, y = create_dataset(scaled_data, time_steps)
    X = np.reshape(X, (X.shape[0], X.shape[1], 1))

    ## Define the LSTM model architecture
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(X.shape[1], 1)))
    model.add(Dropout(0.2))
    model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True))
    model.add(Dropout(0.2))
    model.add(LSTM(units=50))
    model.add(Dropout(0.2))
    model.add(Dense(units=1))

    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, batch_size=32)

    return model
```

In the provided example, the function `train_lstm_forecasting_model` receives mock time series data and trains a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for time series forecasting using TensorFlow and Keras. The function preprocesses the data, defines the LSTM model architecture, compiles the model, and finally trains the model using the provided mock data.

This function is intended for demonstration and educational purposes, and in a real-world scenario, additional considerations such as validation, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation would be crucial for developing an accurate and reliable forecasting model within the FutureScope - AI Forecasting Tool application.

Sure, here is an example of a complex deep learning algorithm using TensorFlow and Keras for the FutureScope - AI Forecasting Tool application. In this example, we'll create a function that defines and trains a deep learning model for time series forecasting using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers.

```python
## File Path: future_scope_ai_forecasting_tool/ai/models/deep_learning_algorithm.py

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv1D, LSTM, Dense, Flatten

def train_deep_learning_forecasting_model(data):
    """
    Train a deep learning-based forecasting model using mock data.

    Args:
    - data: A numpy array of mock time series data (e.g., historical stock prices, weather patterns).

    Returns:
    - trained_model: The trained deep learning forecasting model
    """

    ## Preprocess the data (assuming univariate time series)
    ## ... (Assume data preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and formatting)

    ## Define the architecture of the deep learning model
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Conv1D(filters=64, kernel_size=3, activation='relu', input_shape=(n_timesteps, n_features)))
    model.add(LSTM(50, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dense(1))

    ## Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

    ## Train the model
    X, y = generate_training_data(data)  ## Custom function to prepare training data
    model.fit(X, y, epochs=100, batch_size=32)

    return model
```

In this example, the `train_deep_learning_forecasting_model` function takes mock time series data as input and trains a deep learning forecasting model using a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. The function preprocesses the data, defines the model architecture using Keras Sequential API, compiles the model with an appropriate optimizer and loss function, and trains the model using the provided mock data.

Please note that this example represents a simplified and generic implementation. In a real-world application, additional considerations such as hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and validation would be crucial for developing an accurate and reliable forecasting model within the FutureScope - AI Forecasting Tool application.
