```python
import pandas as pd
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import association_rules

def market_basket_analysis_apriori(data_file_path, min_support=0.01, min_threshold=1.0):
    """
    Perform Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm.
    
    Args:

    min_support (float): Minimum support threshold for Apriori algorithm.
    min_threshold (float): Minimum threshold for association rules.
    
    Returns:
    pd.DataFrame: DataFrame containing the generated association rules.
    """
    ## Load transactional data from file
    transaction_data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Perform one-hot encoding to convert data into transaction sets
    one_hot_encoded = transaction_data.groupby(['TransactionID', 'Item'])['Item'].count().unstack().reset_index().fillna(0).set_index('TransactionID')

    ## Convert all values greater than 1 to 1 (to indicate the presence of item in that transaction)
    one_hot_encoded = one_hot_encoded.applymap(lambda x: 1 if x > 0 else 0)

    ## Apriori algorithm to find frequent item sets
    frequent_itemsets = apriori(one_hot_encoded, min_support=min_support, use_colnames=True)

    ## Generate association rules
    rules = association_rules(frequent_itemsets, metric="lift", min_threshold=min_threshold)

    return rules

## Example usage
file_path = 'data/raw_data/transaction_data.csv'
association_rules_df = market_basket_analysis_apriori(file_path, min_support=0.05, min_threshold=1.2)
print(association_rules_df)
```

In this example, the `market_basket_analysis_apriori` function takes the file path to the transactional data as input and performs Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm. It loads the data, performs one-hot encoding, runs the Apriori algorithm to discover frequent item sets, and then generates association rules based on specified thresholds.

The function returns a DataFrame containing the generated association rules.

When called with mock data, the function demonstrates how the Apriori algorithm can be used to derive association rules from transactional data, providing insights into customer purchase patterns.

```python
import pandas as pd
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import association_rules

def market_basket_analysis_apriori(data_file_path, min_support=0.01, min_threshold=1.0):
    """
    Perform Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm.

    Args:
    data_file_path (str): File path to the transactional data.
    min_support (float): Minimum support threshold for Apriori algorithm.
    min_threshold (float): Minimum threshold for association rules.

    Returns:
    pd.DataFrame: DataFrame containing the generated association rules.
    """

    ## Mock data for demo purposes
    transaction_data = pd.DataFrame({
        'TransactionID': [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3],
        'Item': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'C', 'D', 'B']
    })

    ## Perform one-hot encoding to convert data into transaction sets
    one_hot_encoded = transaction_data.groupby(['TransactionID', 'Item'])['Item'].count().unstack().reset_index().fillna(0).set_index('TransactionID')

    ## Convert all values greater than 1 to 1 (to indicate the presence of item in that transaction)
    one_hot_encoded = one_hot_encoded.applymap(lambda x: 1 if x > 0 else 0)

    ## Apriori algorithm to find frequent item sets
    frequent_itemsets = apriori(one_hot_encoded, min_support=min_support, use_colnames=True)

    ## Generate association rules
    rules = association_rules(frequent_itemsets, metric="lift", min_threshold=min_threshold)

    return rules

## Example usage
file_path = 'data/raw_data/transaction_data.csv'
association_rules_df = market_basket_analysis_apriori(file_path, min_support=0.05, min_threshold=1.2)
print(association_rules_df)
```

In this example, the `market_basket_analysis_apriori` function takes the file path to the transactional data as input and performs Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm. Since the mock data is used for demonstration purposes, the function directly creates a Pandas DataFrame to represent transactional data. It then proceeds with the same data processing and analysis steps as in the previous example.

When called with the provided mock data, the function demonstrates how the Apriori algorithm can be applied to derive association rules from transactional data, providing insights into customer purchase patterns.
