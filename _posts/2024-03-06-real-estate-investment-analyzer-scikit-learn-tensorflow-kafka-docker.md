## Use an official Python runtime as a base image
FROM python:3.8-slim

## Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

## Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

## Install necessary dependencies
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && \
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost tensorflow-serving-api

## Expose the container port
EXPOSE 8500

## Define environment variables
ENV MODEL_PATH=/app/real_estate_model.model

## Command to run the model serving application
CMD tensorflow_model_server --port=8500 --model_name=real_estate_model --model_base_path=$MODEL_PATH
```

### Dockerfile Configuration:

1. **Base Image**:

   - Uses Python 3.8-slim as the base image to minimize the image size.

2. **Working Directory**:

   - Sets the working directory in the container to /app for storing the project files.

3. **Dependency Installation**:

   - Upgrades pip and installs required Python libraries for machine learning (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost) and TensorFlow Serving API.

4. **Exposed Port**:

   - Exposes port 8500 for communication with the TensorFlow Serving instance.

5. **Environment Variables**:

   - Defines an environment variable MODEL_PATH for specifying the saved model path inside the container.

6. **Command to Run**:
   - Starts the TensorFlow model server with the specified port and model base path.

This Dockerfile configuration ensures that the container environment is optimized for serving the machine learning model efficiently, meeting the project's performance and scalability requirements. By following this setup, the model can be deployed seamlessly within a Docker container for production use in real estate investment analysis.
