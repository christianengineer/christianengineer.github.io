### Model Directories (e.g., model1, model2)
Each model directory contains the artifacts related to a specific machine learning model. This approach allows for easy management and enables scalability when introducing new models to the system.

#### Trained Model File (e.g., model1_trained.pkl)
This file contains the serialized form of the trained machine learning model, which can be loaded for making predictions without retraining the model. For instance, in the case of Scikit-Learn models, this file may store the trained `scikit-learn` model in a serialized format using `joblib.dump`.

#### Evaluation Metrics File (e.g., model1_evaluation_metrics.json)
The evaluation metrics file stores the performance metrics of the trained model on validation or test data. It typically includes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and any other domain-specific metrics relevant to the model's evaluation.

#### Deployed Model Directory (e.g., model1_deployed)
This directory contains the necessary files for deploying the model as a service for real-time prediction. For example, it may include a `Dockerfile` for building a containerized deployment environment and the serving script necessary for exposing the model's predictions as an API endpoint.

### Versioning and Modular Deployment
Using separate directories for each model facilitates easy versioning and management of multiple models within the fleet management system. This approach allows for independent updating and deployment of individual models, ensuring flexibility and scalability in the AI-driven decision-making processes.
