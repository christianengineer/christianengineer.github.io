Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a model for the Dynamic Pricing Model for E-commerce using mock data. The script is responsible for loading the mock data, preparing the data, training a TensorFlow model, and saving the trained model artifacts.

```python
## File: model_training_script.py
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

## Load mock data
data_path = 'data/mock_pricing_data.csv'
mock_data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

## Preprocess and prepare the data
## ... (data preprocessing and feature engineering steps)

## Split into features and target
X = mock_data.drop('price', axis=1).values
y = mock_data['price'].values

## Split the data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Define and train a simple TensorFlow model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_val, y_val), epochs=10, batch_size=32)

## Evaluate the model
## ... (evaluation metrics and plots)

## Save the trained model and artifacts
model.save('models/trained_models/version_1')  ## Save the model in SavedModel format
model_metadata = {'version': 1, 'features': list(mock_data.drop('price', axis=1).columns)}
with open('models/trained_models/version_1/model_metadata.json', 'w') as metadata_file:
    json.dump(model_metadata, metadata_file)
```

In this example, the file path for the mock pricing data is assumed to be 'data/mock_pricing_data.csv'. You can adjust the path based on the actual location of the mock data file. After running this script, the trained model and associated artifacts will be saved in the 'models/trained_models/version_1' directory within the project structure.

This script demonstrates the process of model training using mock data, where you can perform data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and artifact saving as part of the training pipeline for the Dynamic Pricing Model for E-commerce.

Certainly! The following is an example of a Python script implementing a complex machine learning algorithm for the Dynamic Pricing Model for E-commerce using mock data. This script demonstrates the training of a more sophisticated model, specifically a Gradient Boosting Regressor from the XGBoost library.

```python
## File: model_training_script.py
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import json

## Load mock data
data_path = 'data/mock_pricing_data.csv'
mock_data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

## Preprocess and prepare the data
## ... (data preprocessing and feature engineering steps)

## Split into features and target
X = mock_data.drop('price', axis=1).values
y = mock_data['price'].values

## Split the data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Define and train a complex XGBoost model
model = xgb.XGBRegressor(objective='reg:squarederror', n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=5)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, eval_set=[(X_val, y_val)], early_stopping_rounds=10, verbose=False)

## Evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_val)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_val, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")

## Save the trained model and artifacts
model.save_model('models/trained_models/version_1/model.xgb')  ## Save the XGBoost model
model_metadata = {'version': 1, 'features': list(mock_data.drop('price', axis=1).columns)}
with open('models/trained_models/version_1/model_metadata.json', 'w') as metadata_file:
    json.dump(model_metadata, metadata_file)
```

In this example, the file path for the mock pricing data is assumed to be 'data/mock_pricing_data.csv'. You can adjust the path based on the actual location of the mock data file. After running this script, the trained XGBoost model will be saved in the 'models/trained_models/version_1' directory within the project structure.

This script showcases the use of a more complex machine learning algorithm (XGBoost) for the Dynamic Pricing Model for E-commerce using mock data, encompassing model training, evaluation, and artifact saving.
