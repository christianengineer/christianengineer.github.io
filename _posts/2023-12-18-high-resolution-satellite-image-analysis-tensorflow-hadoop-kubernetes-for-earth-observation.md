Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a machine learning model using TensorFlow for the High-resolution Satellite Image Analysis application. This example uses mock data for demonstration purposes.

```python
# File Path: model_training_script.py

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import numpy as np

# Mock data generation
num_samples = 1000
image_height = 128
image_width = 128
num_channels = 3

mock_images = np.random.rand(num_samples, image_height, image_width, num_channels)
mock_labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=num_samples)

# Define the model architecture
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(image_height, image_width, num_channels)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(mock_images, mock_labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Save the trained model
model.save('trained_model.h5')
```

In this script, mock data is generated for training a simple convolutional neural network using TensorFlow. The trained model is saved to a file named `trained_model.h5`. This script is an example and would typically be adapted to use actual satellite image data and more complex model architectures for the High-resolution Satellite Image Analysis application.

```python
# File Path: complex_model_training_script.py

# Import necessary libraries
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import numpy as np

# Mock data generation
num_samples = 1000
image_height = 256
image_width = 256
num_channels = 3

mock_images = np.random.rand(num_samples, image_height, image_width, num_channels)
mock_labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=num_samples)

# Define a complex deep learning model architecture
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(image_height, image_width, num_channels)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(256, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.5),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(mock_images, mock_labels, epochs=20, batch_size=32)

# Save the trained model
model.save('trained_complex_model.h5')
```

In this script, a more complex deep learning model architecture is defined and trained using TensorFlow. The trained model is saved to a file named `trained_complex_model.h5`. This file can serve as an example of how to train a complex machine learning algorithm using mock data and can be further customized to use actual satellite image data for the High-resolution Satellite Image Analysis (TensorFlow, Hadoop, Kubernetes) For earth observation application.
