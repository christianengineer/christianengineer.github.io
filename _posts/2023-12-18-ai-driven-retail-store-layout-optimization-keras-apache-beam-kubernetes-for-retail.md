Certainly! Below is an example file that demonstrates the training of a model for the AI-driven Retail Store Layout Optimization using mock data. The Python script utilizes Keras for building and training the machine learning model.

**File Path**: `pipelines/training_pipeline.py`

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

## Load mock data for training
data = {
    'customer_id': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'age': [25, 30, 28, 35, 40],
    'product_category': ['Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Grocery', 'Electronics', 'Beauty'],
    'time_spent_in_store_minutes': [40, 55, 30, 45, 60],
    'amount_spent_dollars': [100, 150, 75, 120, 200],
    'layout_preference': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'A']
}
mock_customer_data = pd.DataFrame(data)

## Feature engineering and preprocessing
## ... (Perform necessary feature engineering and preprocessing of the mock data)

## Define input features and target variable
X = mock_customer_data[['age', 'time_spent_in_store_minutes', 'amount_spent_dollars']]
y = mock_customer_data['layout_preference']

## Define and compile the neural network model using Keras
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, input_dim=3, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, batch_size=1)

## Serialize and save the trained model
model.save('trained_models/store_layout_optimization_model_mock.h5')
```

In this example, the script `training_pipeline.py` utilizes mock customer data to train a basic neural network model using Keras. The trained model is then serialized and saved as `store_layout_optimization_model_mock.h5` within the `trained_models` directory. This file path effectively organizes the training code and the resultant trained model within the project's directory structure, facilitating easy access and management.

```python
## File Path: models/store_layout_optimization_model.py

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
import joblib

## Load mock data for training
data = {
    'customer_id': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'age': [25, 30, 28, 35, 40],
    'product_category': ['Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Grocery', 'Electronics', 'Beauty'],
    'time_spent_in_store_minutes': [40, 55, 30, 45, 60],
    'amount_spent_dollars': [100, 150, 75, 120, 200],
    'layout_preference': [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  ## Binary encoding for layout preference (1 for Layout A, 0 for Layout B)
}
mock_customer_data = pd.DataFrame(data)

## Feature engineering and preprocessing
## ... (Perform complex feature engineering and preprocessing of the mock data, including encoding and scaling)

## Define input features and target variable
X = mock_customer_data[['age', 'time_spent_in_store_minutes', 'amount_spent_dollars']]
y = mock_customer_data['layout_preference']

## Initialize and train a complex machine learning model (Random Forest Regressor)
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X, y)

## Serialize and save the trained model
joblib.dump(model, 'trained_models/store_layout_optimization_model_complex.pkl')
```

In this file, a RandomForestRegressor from the scikit-learn library is used as a complex machine learning algorithm to train the AI-driven Retail Store Layout Optimization model using mock data. The trained model is saved as `store_layout_optimization_model_complex.pkl` within the `trained_models` directory. This file path effectively organizes the training code for the complex model in the project's directory structure, providing clear visibility and access for developers.
