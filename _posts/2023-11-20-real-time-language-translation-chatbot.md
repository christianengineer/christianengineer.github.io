        data = await websocket.receive_text()

        try:
            translation_input = TranslationInput.parse_raw(data)
            translation_output = translator.translate(translation_input.text,

async def translate_text(translation_input: TranslationInput):
    translator = TranslationService()

    try:
        translation_output = translator.translate(translation_input.text,
                                                  translation_input.source_language,
                                                  translation_input.target_language)

class TranslationService:
    # Placeholder for translation service logic
    def translate(self, text: str, source_language: str, target_language: str) -> str:
        # The translation logic would be much more complex and involve AI models,
        # but this is a simplified example.
        if source_language == target_language:

    @staticmethod
    def dummy_translation(text: str, _target_language: str) -> str:
        # In a real-world scenario, this would interface with an ML model or
        # a third-party translation service.
        return f'Translated "{text}" to {_target_language} language.'

```

This file represents the API routes for a real-time language translation chatbot. It includes a WebSocket endpoint for live translation during chat sessions and a regular HTTP POST route for standard translation requests. The `TranslationService` class is a placeholder for the actual translation logic, which would involve sophisticated AI models or interfaces with third-party translation APIs in a production environment. The routes are set up using FastAPI, with data validation and serialization for input and output using Pydantic models.

### Fictitious File for Real-Time Language Translation Chatbot AI Logic

File Path: `/ai_models/nlp/translation_model.py`

```python
# translation_model.py

import torch
from transformers import MarianMTModel, MarianTokenizer

# TranslationModel encapsulates the MarianMT Model for translation
class TranslationModel:
    def __init__(self, source_lang: str, target_lang: str):
        """
        Initializes the translation model with pre-trained model parameters.

        :param source_lang: ISO code for source language
        :param target_lang: ISO code for target language
        """
        model_name = f"Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-{source_lang}-{target_lang}"
        self.tokenizer = MarianTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.model = MarianMTModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

        # Device setup for utilizing GPU when available
        self.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
        self.model.to(self.device)

    def translate(self, text: str) -> str:
        """
        Translates the given text from the source to target language.

        :param text: Text in the source language to be translated
        :return: Translated text in the target language
        """
        # Preprocess and tokenize the input text
        preprocessed_text = self._preprocess(text)
        tokenized_text = self.tokenizer.encode(preprocessed_text, return_tensors="pt")
        tokenized_text = tokenized_text.to(self.device)

        # Perform the translation and decode the output
        translated = self.model.generate(tokenized_text)
        translated_text = self.tokenizer.decode(translated[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

        return translated_text

    def _preprocess(self, text: str) -> str:
        """
        Applies necessary preprocessing steps for the input text.

        :param text: Raw text input

        return text.strip()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage
    source_language = "en"
    target_language = "es"
    translator = TranslationModel(source_language, target_language)

    example_text = "Hello, world!"
    print(f"Translating '{example_text}' to {target_language}:")
    print(translator.translate(example_text))
```

**Important Notes:**

1. This is a simplified version of the logic that a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer might implement in a real-world scenario.
2. The usage of `transformers` library presumes access to pre-trained models suitable for the MarianMT model, which might need significant computational resources.
3. Actual deployment would require careful management of computational resources, preprocessing, error handling, and could involve using more efficient language-specific tokenizers or handling multiple translation directions dynamically.
4. This file is intended to be part of a larger repository with a robust directory structure encompassing various AI and NLP components, as well as integration with web services for real-time chat translation capabilities.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script that could be responsible for the AI logic of handling the real-time translation tasks within the Real-Time Language Translation Chatbot. The script uses a pre-trained model from Hugging Face's Transformers library to translate input text into the target language.

Keep in mind, this code is fictional and may not be fully functional or optimized. It is meant to illustrate the type of content and file structure that might be included in a candidate's project.

```python
# File Path: /real-time-translation-chatbot/ai_models/nlp/translation_service.py

from transformers import MarianMTModel, MarianTokenizer

class TranslationService:
    def __init__(self, model_name):
        """
        Initializes the TranslationService with a specific translation model.
        :param model_name: str, the name of the model to be used for translation.
        """
        self.tokenizer = MarianTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.model = MarianMTModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

    def translate(self, text, src_lang, tgt_lang):

        :param tgt_lang: str, the target language code (ISO 639-1).
        :return: str, the translated text.
        """
        # Constructing the model name based on the source and target languages
        model_name = f'Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-{src_lang}-{tgt_lang}'

        # Reinitialize the tokenizer and model in case of language change
        self.tokenizer = MarianTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.model = MarianMTModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

        # Tokenize and prepare input for the model
        tokenized_text = self.tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)

        # Perform translation
        translated = self.model.generate(**tokenized_text)

        # Decode the output tokens to a string
        translation = self.tokenizer.decode(translated[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

        return translation

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Translate English to Spanish
    translator = TranslationService('Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-es')
    sample_text = "Hello, world! This is an example translation."
    print(f"Original: {sample_text}")
    translated_text = translator.translate(sample_text, 'en', 'es')
    print(f"Translated: {translated_text}")
```

The file should be placed in the project directory dedicated to translation models within the NLP section of the AI models. This script provides a foundational structure for the translation service that would be used in the translation chatbot. It showcases the translation function, which has to be both accurate and efficient, given the real-time requirement of the chatbot service.

```
/backend/app/api/translation_routes.py
```

```python
# translation_routes.py

from fastapi import APIRouter, WebSocket, WebSocketDisconnect
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from typing import List
from ..services.translation_service import TranslationService
from ..models.messages import ChatMessage, TranslatedMessage

            )

            # Send the translated message back to the client
            await websocket.send_json(translated_message.dict())
    except WebSocketDisconnect:
        print(f"WebSocket disconnected for user_id: {user_id}")
        # Handle disconnection, e.g., clean up, log, etc.

@router.post("/translate")
async def translate_text_endpoint(chat_message: ChatMessage):
    # Translate text using translation service
    translation = await translation_service.translate_text(
        chat_message.text,

    )

    # Return JSON response with the translated message
    return JSONResponse(status_code=200, content=translated_message.dict())
```

This fictitious file `translation_routes.py` is located in the path `/backend/app/api/` of the Real-Time Language Translation Chatbot repository. It defines two endpoints using FastAPI: a WebSocket endpoint for real-time communication and a standard POST endpoint for text translation requests.

The WebSocket endpoint establishes a connection with a client and listens for incoming messages, which are then passed to the translation service. Translated text is sent back to the client in real-time using WebSocket communication.

The POST endpoint provides a RESTful way to access translation services. Clients can send JSON-formatted text that includes the source and target languages, which is then translated, and the response is returned as a JSON object.

The code demonstrates an understanding of asynchronous operations, API design, data modeling with Pydantic (for parsing and validation of the request and response data), and real-time web technologies, which are all desirable skills for a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer at an AI startup.
