```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

def train_and_evaluate_model(data_file_path):
    # Load mock data
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Preprocessing and feature extraction
    X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = data['target']

    # Split data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize model
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

    # Train model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

    return model, accuracy, report

# Example usage
data_file_path = "data/mock_customer_data.csv"
trained_model, model_accuracy, evaluation_report = train_and_evaluate_model(data_file_path)
print("Model accuracy:", model_accuracy)
print("Evaluation report:\n", evaluation_report)
```

In this example, the `train_and_evaluate_model` function loads mock customer data from a CSV file specified by the `data_file_path`, preprocesses the data, trains a RandomForestClassifier model, evaluates its performance, and returns the trained model along with its accuracy and evaluation report.

The `data/mock_customer_data.csv` file path is used as a placeholder for the actual file path where the mock customer data is stored. The function demonstrates the training and evaluation of a complex machine learning algorithm using the scikit-learn library, and it can be further customized and extended to support more sophisticated machine learning models as needed for the ServiceAI AI for Customer Service application.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

def train_and_evaluate_deep_learning_model(data_file_path):
    # Load mock data
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Preprocessing and feature extraction
    X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = data['target']

    # Normalize feature data
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_normalized = scaler.fit_transform(X)

    # Split data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_normalized, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize deep learning model
    model = Sequential([
        Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
        Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    # Evaluate the model
    y_pred = (model.predict(X_test) > 0.5).astype("int32")
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

    return model, accuracy, report

# Example usage
data_file_path = "data/mock_customer_data.csv"
trained_dl_model, dl_model_accuracy, dl_evaluation_report = train_and_evaluate_deep_learning_model(data_file_path)
print("Deep Learning Model accuracy:", dl_model_accuracy)
print("Deep Learning Evaluation report:\n", dl_evaluation_report)
```

In this example, the `train_and_evaluate_deep_learning_model` function loads mock customer data from a CSV file specified by the `data_file_path`, preprocesses the data, constructs a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras, trains the model, evaluates its performance, and returns the trained deep learning model along with its accuracy and evaluation report.

The `data/mock_customer_data.csv` file path is used as a placeholder for the actual file path where the mock customer data is stored. The function demonstrates the training and evaluation of a complex deep learning algorithm using the TensorFlow/Keras library, and it can be further customized and extended to support more advanced deep learning architectures as needed for the ServiceAI AI for Customer Service application.
