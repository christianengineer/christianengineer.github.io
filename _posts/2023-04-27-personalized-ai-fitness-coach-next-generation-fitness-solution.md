# Personalized AI Fitness Coach Repository

## Description:

Our project, the Personalized AI Fitness Coach, is an innovative, digital solution that aims to revolutionize the fitness and health industry. This repository hosts the joint efforts of our talented team as we create an intelligent trainer that can provide individualized fitness instruction and health advice to our users. By leveraging the power of AI and machine learning, we will create a product that factors in each end user's unique body type, fitness level, health goals, and time constraints to create custom-tailored workout and meal plans.

## Goals:

1. **Personalized Fitness Program**: Create an AI model that provides personalized exercise routines to users based on individual body metrics, personal goals (weight loss, muscle gain, maintain current physique), and available workout equipment.

2. **Diet Recommendations**: Integrate nutrition-focused AI algorithms to provide meal recommendations that complement the user's fitness program, considering dietary restrictions and preferences.

3. **Progress Tracking**: Implement features for users to track progress over time and adjust plans according to real-time results.

4. **User-Experience**: Develop a user-friendly interface that is intuitive to navigate and aesthetically pleasing. The AI functionalities should be seamlessly integrated, fostering trust and engagement from users.

## Libraries and Tools:

The technologies that we might utilize in this project include but are not limited to:

- **TensorFlow**: This library will let us build and train our deep learning models

- **Keras**: As a user-friendly neural network library written in Python, Keras will be especially useful when prototyping our AI model.

- **Scikit-learn**: This library will help us with various tasks, such as model selection, pre-processing, and evaluation metrics.

- **Pandas**: This library will assist in manipulating numerical tables and time-series data more efficiently.

- **NumPy**: These numerical Python libraries will help perform mathematical and logical operations on arrays.

- **Flask/Django**: For the backend, we'll use Flask or Django to handle requests and responses for the server.

- **React**: For scalable frontend development, ReactJS will be instrumental due to its ability to handle large amounts of data without slowing down the user experience.

- **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: These relational databases will be used to store and retrieve user information securely and efficiently.

- **Docker/Kubernetes**: These will be used for automating deployment, scaling, and managing our application's containerized system effectively.

Please remember this is just a short list of potential libraries and tools we may use. We'll be adjusting and revising this list as we continue to develop and optimize our AI Fitness Coach.

# File Structure of the Personalized AI Fitness Coach repository

Below you will find a suggested file structure for the Personalized AI Fitness Coach repository. This structure aims to keep components modular and scalable for easier collaboration and development.

```

```

This file structure separates the project based on functionality which aligns with the concept of Separation of Concerns.

Each folder has its own role:

- **backend**: houses the server-side code, including the machine learning models and APIs.
- **frontend**: contains all the client-side code for the user interface (UI).
- **db**: used for database scripts and related files.
- **docs**: dedicated folder for storing project's documentation

Lastly, files like `.gitignore` and `README.md` reside in the root directory for ease of access.

Sure! Here is an outline of a fictitious Python script, called `ai_coach.py`, that would ostensibly handle the logic for the Personalized AI Fitness Coach. This file will reside in the backend folder following the file structure we created above.

```
backend/app/ai_coach.py
```

```python
#  ai_coach.py

from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import tensorflow as tf
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout
from keras.utils import to_categorical
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

class AIFitnessCoach:
    def __init__(self, user_data):
        self.user_data = user_data

    def preprocess_data(self):
        """
        Preprocess the incoming user data for AI model
        """

    def build_model(self):
        """
        Build and compile the AI model
        """

    def train_model(self):
        """
        Train the AI model with the provided user data
        """

    def make_recommendations(self):
        """
        Generate recommendations based on the model's predictions
        """

    def track_progress(self):
        """
        Track and store user's progress over time
        """

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Instantiate the AIFitnessCoach class with user data
```

This file is merely a simplified representation and may not encompass the full complexity of the AI logic required for a personalized fitness coach. It's intended to give a basic idea of what the file could potentially contain. The actual file would, of course, include complete function definitions along with the necessary dataset import, data preprocessing, model creation, model training, recommendations, and progress tracking code.
