We will focus on TensorFlow for deep learning tasks and GeoPandas for geospatial data analysis to effectively locate potential copper deposits in Peru for Compañía Minera Antapaccay. By analyzing geological data using AI algorithms, the project aims to enhance the discovery rates of copper deposits and improve the mining company's operational planning.

## Target Variable

`Copper Deposit Probability`: This variable represents the likelihood of a specific location containing a copper deposit based on the geological data analysis conducted by the AI model.

## Importance of the Target Variable

Decision Making: The `Copper Deposit Probability` variable is crucial for making informed decisions regarding where to focus exploration efforts. Areas with high probabilities can be prioritized for further investigation, leading to more efficient resource allocation.

## Example Values and Decision-Making

**High Probability**: Consider a location with a `Copper Deposit Probability` of 0.9. This high probability indicates a substantial likelihood of a copper deposit. In such a case, the company may decide to conduct detailed surveys and drilling in that area to confirm the presence of copper deposits.

**Low Probability**: A location with a probability of 0.1 suggests a low chance of a copper deposit and helps avoid spending resources on areas with minimal potential for copper deposits.

**Medium Probability**: A probability of 0.5 implies an ambiguous situation in which further analysis or on-ground exploration may be required to determine the presence of copper deposits, which would assist in making more strategic decisions.

Using the `Copper Deposit Probability` variable generated by the AI model, the exploration geologists at Compañía Minera Antapaccay can effectively locate new copper deposits, optimize their exploration efforts, and improve operational planning for future mining activities.

## Secondary Target Variable

An insightful secondary target variable, which we'll refer to as `Copper Deposit Size`, could significantly enhance our predictive model's accuracy and provide valuable insights in the field of mining exploration.

### Importance of `Copper Deposit Size`

- **Granularity of Information**: `Copper Deposit Size` provides information on the scale and magnitude of copper deposits, ranging from small to large sizes. This data can offer valuable insights for operational planning and resource estimation.

### Complementing `Copper Deposit Probability`

- **Decision Making**: By incorporating `Copper Deposit Size` alongside `Copper Deposit Probability`, the predictive model can offer a more comprehensive view of potential copper deposits. For instance, a high probability coupled with a large deposit size signifies a lucrative mining opportunity.

### Example Values and Decision Making

- **Small Deposit Size**: A location with a `Copper Deposit Size` of 100 tons indicates a smaller copper deposit. While the probability of occurrence may be high, the size suggests limited mining potential, guiding decisions on the feasibility of extraction.

- **Large Deposit Size**: In contrast, a deposit size of 1,000 tons represents a substantial copper reserve. When combined with a high `Copper Deposit Probability`, this information could prompt significant investment and strategic planning for large-scale mining operations.

- **Medium Deposit Size**: A deposit size of 500 tons falls in the mid-range category. This scenario could trigger further exploration and analysis to determine the economic viability and extraction feasibility, leveraging both the probability and size metrics.

By incorporating `Copper Deposit Size` as a secondary target variable in the predictive model alongside `Copper Deposit Probability`, exploration geologists can gain a deeper understanding of the potential copper deposits' scale and economic value. This synergistic approach can propel groundbreaking advancements in mining exploration by facilitating informed decision-making and optimizing resource utilization for Compañía Minera Antapaccay in Peru.

## Third Target Variable

A valuable third target variable, which we'll refer to as `Copper Deposit Depth`, can significantly enhance our predictive model's accuracy and insights in the field of mining exploration.

### Importance of `Copper Deposit Depth`

- **Depth Information**: `Copper Deposit Depth` provides crucial data on how deep underground the copper deposits are located. This information is essential for assessing the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of extraction.

### Complementing `Copper Deposit Probability` and `Copper Deposit Size`

- **Geological Understanding**: By incorporating `Copper Deposit Depth` along with `Copper Deposit Probability` and `Copper Deposit Size`, the predictive model can offer a more comprehensive understanding of potential copper deposits. The depth factor adds another dimension to the exploration process.

### Example Values and Decision Making

- **Shallow Deposit Depth**: A depth of 50 meters signifies a shallow copper deposit. Combined with high `Copper Deposit Probability` and a large `Copper Deposit Size`, this information indicates a favorable mining opportunity with accessible resources.

- **Deep Deposit Depth**: Conversely, a depth of 500 meters represents a deep-seated copper deposit. Understanding this depth, alongside probability and size metrics, helps in planning for advanced mining techniques and assessing extraction challenges.

- **Medium Deposit Depth**: A depth of 200 meters falls in the moderate range. This scenario prompts further analysis to determine the logistical requirements and extraction methods needed for optimal resource utilization.

By incorporating `Copper Deposit Depth` as a third target variable in the predictive model alongside `Copper Deposit Probability` and `Copper Deposit Size`, exploration geologists can gain comprehensive insights into the spatial, volumetric, and vertical distribution of copper deposits. This holistic approach enables informed decision-making, strategic resource planning, and cost-effective mining operations for Compañía Minera Antapaccay in Peru.
