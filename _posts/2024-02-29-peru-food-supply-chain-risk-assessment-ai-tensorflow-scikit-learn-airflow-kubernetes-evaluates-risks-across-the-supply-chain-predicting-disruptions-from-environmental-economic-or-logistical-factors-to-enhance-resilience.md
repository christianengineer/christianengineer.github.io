## File Path: src/model_training/train_model.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import joblib

## Mock data generation
X = np.random.rand(100, 5)  ## 100 samples with 5 features
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)  ## Binary labels

## Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Train a RandomForestClassifier model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

## Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
