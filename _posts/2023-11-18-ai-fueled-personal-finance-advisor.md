# AI-Fueled Personal Finance Advisor

## Description

The AI-Fueled Personal Finance Advisor is a web-based application that utilizes artificial intelligence technologies to provide personalized financial advice to users. The application aims to help individuals make better financial decisions, manage their budgets effectively, and achieve their financial goals.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of the application are:

1. **Efficient Data Management**: The application should efficiently store and manage user data, financial transactions, and other relevant information.

2. **High User Traffic Handling**: The application should be capable of handling a large number of concurrent users and delivering fast response times, especially during peak traffic periods.

## Data Management

### Backend Database

To efficiently store and manage user data, a relational database management system (RDBMS) will be utilized. Given the need for data consistency and reliability, PostgreSQL is chosen as our database engine. Its ACID compliance, robustness, and support for complex queries make it an ideal choice for our application.

### Caching

To improve response times and reduce database load, a caching mechanism will be implemented. Redis will be utilized as an in-memory data store and cache due to its high performance, scalability, and ability to handle a large number of simultaneous connections.

## User Traffic Handling

### Load Balancing

To distribute incoming user traffic across multiple servers and ensure high availability, a load balancing mechanism will be employed. Nginx will be used as the load balancer due to its high performance, easy configuration, and support for distributed caching.

### Server-Side Rendering

To improve initial page load times and enhance the user experience, server-side rendering (SSR) will be implemented. Next.js, a React framework, provides built-in SSR capabilities, making it a seamless choice for our application.

### WebSocket Communication

To provide real-time updates and notifications, WebSocket communication will be employed. Socket.IO, a WebSocket library, will be used due to its simplicity, reliability, and ability to handle bidirectional communication between the server and client.

## Summary Section

In summary, the AI-Fueled Personal Finance Advisor application will utilize PostgreSQL as the backend database for efficient data management. Redis will be employed for caching, Nginx for load balancing, Next.js for server-side rendering, and Socket.IO for WebSocket communication. These technologies have been carefully chosen based on their performance, scalability, and developer-friendly features to ensure efficient data management and high user traffic handling in the application.

By leveraging PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx, Next.js, and Socket.IO, we can achieve the objectives of efficient data management and high user traffic handling, enabling us to deliver a fast, reliable, and scalable AI-fueled personal finance advisor to our users.

Sure! Here's an example of a file detailing the core logic of the AI-Fueled Personal Finance Advisor:

File path: `src/screens/FinanceAdvisor.js`

```javascript
// src/screens/FinanceAdvisor.js

import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { fetchTransactions } from '../services/api';
import { calculateMetrics, generateRecommendations } from '../services/ai';
import Dashboard from './Dashboard';

const FinanceAdvisor = () => {
  const [transactions, setTransactions] = useState([]);
  const [metrics, setMetrics] = useState(null);
  const [recommendations, setRecommendations] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch transactions from the server
    const fetchFinanceData = async () => {
      try {
        const data = await fetchTransactions();
        setTransactions(data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching transactions:', error);
      }
    };

    // Call the finance data fetching function
    fetchFinanceData();
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Calculate financial metrics based on fetched transactions
    const calculateFinanceMetrics = () => {
      const updatedMetrics = calculateMetrics(transactions);
      setMetrics(updatedMetrics);
    };

    // Generate AI-powered recommendations based on financial metrics
    const generateFinanceRecommendations = () => {
      const updatedRecommendations = generateRecommendations(metrics);
      setRecommendations(updatedRecommendations);
    };

    // Call the calculation and recommendation generation functions
    if (transactions.length > 0) {
      calculateFinanceMetrics();
      generateFinanceRecommendations();
    }
  }, [transactions]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>AI-Fueled Personal Finance Advisor</h1>
      {transactions.length === 0 ? (
        <p>Loading transactions...</p>
      ) : (
        <Dashboard
          transactions={transactions}
          metrics={metrics}
          recommendations={recommendations}
        />
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default FinanceAdvisor;
```

Explanation of the core logic code:
- The `FinanceAdvisor` component is responsible for fetching financial data, calculating metrics, generating recommendations, and rendering the `Dashboard` component.
- It makes use of the `fetchTransactions` function from the `../services/api` module to fetch transaction data from the server.
- Once the transactions are fetched, it uses the `calculateMetrics` function from the `../services/ai` module to calculate financial metrics based on the transactions.
- It then uses the `generateRecommendations` function from the `../services/ai` module to generate AI-powered recommendations based on the calculated metrics.
- The fetched transactions, calculated metrics, and generated recommendations are passed as props to the `Dashboard` component for rendering.
- The component includes an initial check to display a loading message while transactions are being fetched.
- The `useEffect` hooks are used to trigger the functions responsible for calculating metrics and generating recommendations whenever transactions change.

This file demonstrates the core logic of the AI-Fueled Personal Finance Advisor, combining data fetching, AI-based calculations, and rendering of the UI components.

Certainly! Here's an example of another core file for the AI-Fueled Personal Finance Advisor, focusing on user authentication:

File path: `src/utils/auth.js`

```javascript
// src/utils/auth.js

import { loginAPI, logoutAPI, getUserAPI } from '../services/api';

export const login = async (username, password) => {
  try {
    const response = await loginAPI(username, password);
    const { token } = response.data;

    // Save token to local storage or cookies
    localStorage.setItem('token', token);

    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error during login:', error);
    return false;
  }
};

export const logout = async () => {
  try {
    // Clear token from local storage or cookies
    localStorage.removeItem('token');
    await logoutAPI();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error during logout:', error);
  }
};

export const getUser = async () => {
  try {
    // Retrieve token from local storage or cookies
    const token = localStorage.getItem('token');

    if (!token) {
      throw new Error('No token found');
    }

    const response = await getUserAPI(token);
    const user = response.data;

    return user;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error during getUser:', error);
    return null;
  }
};
```

Explanation of the authorization logic code:
- The `auth.js` module provides functions for user authentication and authorization.
- It imports API functions (`loginAPI`, `logoutAPI`, `getUserAPI`) from `../services/api` for interacting with the server.
- The `login` function handles the login process by making a request to the server with the provided username and password. If successful, it saves the returned token to local storage or cookies.
- The `logout` function clears the token from local storage or cookies and makes a request to the server for logging out the user.
- The `getUser` function retrieves the token from local storage or cookies, makes a request to the server with the token to get the user information. It returns the user object if successful or `null` if not.
- Other modules and components within the application can import and utilize these functions for authentication and user-related operations.

Integration with other files:
- Other files, such as login and registration components, user dashboard components, and API service modules, can import and use the `login`, `logout`, and `getUser` functions from `auth.js` for handling user authentication and authorization.
- For example, during the login process, the login/sign-in component can call the `login` function to authenticate the user and save the returned token to local storage or cookies.
- The user dashboard components can utilize the `getUser` function to fetch the user information and display personalized data.
- The API service modules can use the `getUser` function to get the token for authentication purposes while making authenticated API requests to the server.

This file provides a centralized and reusable set of functions for handling user authentication and authorization across the application.

Certainly! Here's an example of another core file for the AI-Fueled Personal Finance Advisor, focusing on the AI-powered recommendation engine:

File path: `src/services/recommendations.js`

```javascript
// src/services/recommendations.js

import { fetchRecommendationsAPI } from './api';

export const fetchRecommendations = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetchRecommendationsAPI();
    const recommendations = response.data;

    return recommendations;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching recommendations:', error);
    return [];
  }
};

export const generateAIRecommendations = (metrics) => {
  // Implementation of AI-powered recommendation generation algorithm based on metrics
  // Returns an array of recommended actions or suggestions
  // This logic can be customized based on the specific requirements

  // Example implementation:
  const recommendations = [];
  if (metrics.savingsRate < 0.1) {
    recommendations.push('Increase your savings rate to reach your financial goals');
  }
  if (metrics.creditCardUtilization > 0.5) {
    recommendations.push('Lower your credit card utilization for better financial health');
  }

  return recommendations;
};
```

Explanation of the recommendation engine code:
- The `recommendations.js` module provides functions for fetching recommendations from the server and for generating AI-powered recommendations based on financial metrics.
- It imports the `fetchRecommendationsAPI` function from `./api` to fetch the recommendations from the server.
- The `fetchRecommendations` function makes an API request to fetch recommendations from the server.
- The `generateAIRecommendations` function takes financial metrics as input and generates AI-powered recommendations based on those metrics. The logic can be customized based on specific requirements and can use machine learning algorithms or predefined rules.
- It returns an array of recommended actions or suggestions.
- Other files, such as the finance advisor component or dashboard component, can import and utilize these functions for fetching recommendations and displaying AI-powered recommendations to the user.

Integration with other files:
- The previously outlined `FinanceAdvisor.js` file can import and use the `fetchRecommendations` function from `recommendations.js` to fetch recommendations from the server and store them in the component state.
- The `FinanceAdvisor.js` file can also import the `generateAIRecommendations` function from `recommendations.js` to generate AI-powered recommendations based on the calculated metrics and display them to the user through the `Dashboard.js` component or similar components.

This file plays a crucial role in generating personalized AI-powered recommendations for the users of the AI-Fueled Personal Finance Advisor. It is dependent on the `api.js` file for making API requests to fetch recommendations from the server, and can utilize the financial metrics calculated from the transaction data stored in the `FinanceAdvisor.js` file.
