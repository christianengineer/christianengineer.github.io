In this scalable file structure for the Affordable Housing Analysis repository, the main components are organized into directories as follows:

- **data/**: Contains subdirectories for raw data, processed data, and external data. Raw data includes original datasets, processed data holds cleaned and transformed datasets, and external data stores additional external datasets used for analysis.

- **models/**: Stores trained machine learning models, such as model1.pkl, model2.pkl, and so on.

- **notebooks/**: Includes Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- **src/**: Houses the source code for data processing, model training, visualization, and application development.

- **tests/**: Contains unit tests for data processing, modeling, visualization, and other functionalities.

- **config/**: Stores configuration files, such as config.yaml, for managing application settings.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for running the application.

- **README.md**: Provides documentation and instructions for setting up and using the repository.

This organized file structure facilitates modular development, version control, testing, and deployment of the Affordable Housing Analysis application, ensuring scalability and maintainability as the project grows.

```

├── model1.pkl
├── model2.pkl
└── ...
```

In the models directory for the Affordable Housing Analysis application, trained machine learning models are stored as serialized files. These models are saved in a format that allows for easy loading and deployment within the application. The models directory may contain the following files and associated information:

- **model1.pkl**: This file represents a trained machine learning model, for example, a regression model built using Scikit-Learn to predict housing prices based on various features.

- **model2.pkl**: Another trained machine learning model, potentially a classification model or clustering model, addressing a different aspect of affordable housing analysis, such as identifying neighborhoods at risk of gentrification.

- **...**: Additional model files, with each file representing a distinct trained model designed to solve specific problems within the context of affordable housing analysis.

Each model file encapsulates the model's architecture, trained parameters, and metadata necessary for prediction. When integrated into the application, these serialized model files can be loaded and used to make predictions or perform other tasks relevant to the analysis of affordable housing data.

As the application evolves, the models directory may expand to include versions of models, model ensembles, or models trained using different algorithms to address diverse aspects of urban development and affordable housing. Proper versioning and documentation for each model file are essential to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and ongoing maintenance of the machine learning models.

As the Affordable Housing Analysis application integrates machine learning models and a user interface, the deployment directory accommodates the necessary components for deploying the application's predictive and analytical features. The deployment directory may include the following structure:

```
deployment/
├── app/
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── api.py
│   └── ...
├── static/
│   ├── styles.css
│   └── ...
└── templates/
    ├── index.html
    └── ...
```

### Components within the Deployment Directory:

#### app/

- **main.py**: A Python file serving as the primary entry point for the web application, integrating the user interface with the backend functionality, including model loading, data processing, and result visualization.
- **api.py**: Contains code for RESTful API endpoints to handle model predictions, data retrieval, and other backend services.

#### static/

- **styles.css**: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) file defining the visual presentation and layout of the web pages, contributing to the application's aesthetic and user experience.

#### templates/

- **index.html**: An HTML template serving as the main page for the web application, containing the structural markup and placeholders for dynamic content, such as dynamically generated visualizations and predictive insights.

Within the deployment directory, these files and subdirectories support the deployment of the application, enabling the user interface to interact with the machine learning models and underlying data processing logic. The deployment architecture may extend to include additional directories for resource management, logging, and scalability considerations, as the application evolves and demands more sophisticated deployment capabilities.

Here's an example of a Python script for training a Scikit-Learn model for the Affordable Housing Analysis application using mock data. This script assumes that mock data is available in a CSV file named "mock_housing_data.csv" in the "data/raw/" directory within the project.

File Path: `src/models/train_model.py`

```python
## src/models/train_model.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import joblib

## Load mock housing data
data_path = "../../data/raw/mock_housing_data.csv"
housing_data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

## Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering (not shown in this example)

## Define features and target variable
X = housing_data.drop("target_column", axis=1)  ## Replace "target_column" with actual target variable
y = housing_data["target_column"]  ## Replace "target_column" with actual target variable

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Initialize and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

## Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)

## Save the trained model
model_path = "../../models/linear_regression_model.pkl"
joblib.dump(model, model_path)
print("Model saved at:", model_path)
```

In this script, a Linear Regression model is trained using the mock housing data from the CSV file. The trained model is then evaluated using mean squared error and saved as a serialized file "linear_regression_model.pkl" in the "models/" directory within the project. The preprocessing and feature engineering steps are assumed to have been performed as part of the data preprocessing pipeline.

This file demonstrates a simplified model training process and can be further extended with more advanced modeling techniques and data preprocessing steps as needed for the Affordable Housing Analysis application.

```python
## File Path: src/models/train_complex_model.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import joblib

## Load mock housing data
data_path = "../../data/raw/mock_housing_data.csv"
housing_data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

## Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering (not shown in this example)

## Define features and target variable
X = housing_data.drop("target_column", axis=1)  ## Replace "target_column" with actual target variable
y = housing_data["target_column"]  ## Replace "target_column" with actual target variable

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Initialize and train the model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, max_depth=10, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

## Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)

## Save the trained model
model_path = "../../models/random_forest_model.pkl"
joblib.dump(model, model_path)
print("Model saved at:", model_path)
```

In this Python script, a Random Forest Regressor, a more complex machine learning algorithm, is trained using the mock housing data. The trained model is then evaluated using mean squared error and saved as a serialized file "random_forest_model.pkl" in the "models/" directory within the project. As in the previous example, data preprocessing and feature engineering steps are assumed to have been performed as part of the data pipeline. This script can be further customized to incorporate additional preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation techniques based on the specific requirements of the Affordable Housing Analysis application.
