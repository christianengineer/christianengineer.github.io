      This table contrasts dominant phrases, which assert control and unilateral
      decision-making, with leadership phrases that invite collaboration and
      team input. The leadership phrases aim to foster a team environment where
      all members feel valued and heard, particularly when it comes to technical
      decisions in front-end development.

          <td>
            &quot;I recommend transitioning our services to Node.js for better

            &quot;Based on its wide adoption and flexibility, I suggest Express
