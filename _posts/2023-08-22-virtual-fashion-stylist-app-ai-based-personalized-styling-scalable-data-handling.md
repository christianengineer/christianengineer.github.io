# Virtual Fashion Stylist App

## Description

The Virtual Fashion Stylist App is an innovative solution designed to redefine the shopping experience. The app serves as an intelligent stylist that uses advanced machine learning algorithms and AI technology to understand user preference and style. It provides personalized clothing and accessory recommendations based on style trends, weather condition, regional fashion, occasion, and user's body type and color preferences. Using cerebral interfaces, it can couple with optical devices to enable users to virtually try the recommended outfits.

## Goals

- **Personalized Styling:** Provide personalized fashion suggestions based on user preferences and body type
- **Aesthetic Presentability:** Ensure a visually engaging UI/UX design that is both efficient and user-friendly.
- **Virtual Fitting:** Integrate technology to allow users to virtually try their outfits
- **Scalable Architecture:** Implement a scalable framework to support increasing user traffic and data handling.

## Libraries for Backend and Data handling:

1. **Express.js:** As a minimum web application framework, Express.js allows us to build our web application more effortlessly. Its features like simplicity, flexibility, scalability, and a bunch of HTTP utility methods make it fit for backend development.

2. **MongoDB:** As a NoSQL cross-platform document-oriented database program, MongoDB suffices the need for high volume data storage. It aids in storing data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be altered over time.

3. **Mongoose:** An ORM(Object-relational mapping) that provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. Provides features like data validation, querying, and hooks to our MongoDB collections.

4. **Redis:** To cache data. It’s an open-source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker.

## Libraries for Frontend and UI:

5. **ReactJS:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Known for its adjustability, scalability, and simplicity. We will use this to create the app’s frontend.

6. **Redux:** A popular open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It acts as a state container for JavaScript apps, which helps in managing data you don't want to put in a component's local state.

7. **Material-UI:** A popular react framework offering a rich set of pre-defined styles and components following material design principles.

## Libraries for Scalable User Traffic Handling:

8. **Nginx:** A free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy, as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server. Known for its high performance, stability, rich features, simple configuration, and low resource consumption.

9. **PM2:** It’s a Production Runtime and Process Manager for Node.js applications with a built-in Load Balancer. It allows you to keep applications alive forever, reload them without downtime, helps in common administrative tasks, and facilitates common Systemd commands. 

The Virtual Fashion Stylist App aims to revolutionize the fashion industry by leveraging next-level AI technology to provide a customized fashion solution for each individual. As a Full Stack Software Engineer, your contribution will be at the heart of this pioneering endeavour.

Certainly. Below is a scalable and maintainable file structure to the Virtual Fashion Stylist App repository:

```markdown

```

It is recommended to keep server and client codebases separate (through the two directories `client` and `server`) for better separation of concerns. This also provides the flexibility to scale up the frontend and backend independently based on the load. Remember that it's good to tailor the structure based on your application needs and team preferences.

Certainly, below is a fictitious JavaScript file `virtualStylist.js` that would handle the logic for Virtual Fashion Stylist App. 

This file will be located in the `services` directory of the `server` folder. 

```markdown
/server/services/virtualStylist.js
```

The file could look something like this:

```javascript

const StylistService = require('./stylistService');
const UserPreferenceService = require('./userPreferenceService');
const OutfitRecommendationService = require('./outfitRecommendationService');

class VirtualStylistService {

    constructor() {
        this.stylistService = new StylistService();
        this.userPreferenceService = new UserPreferenceService();
        this.outfitRecommendationService = new OutfitRecommendationService();
    }

    async getUserStyle(userId) {
        const userPreferences = await this.userPreferenceService.getUserPreferences(userId);
        const stylistResponse = await this.stylistService.analyzeResponse(userId);
        return { ...userPreferences, ...stylistResponse };
    }

    async getOutfitRecommendation(userId) {
        const userStyle = await this.getUserStyle(userId);
        const recommendation = await this.outfitRecommendationService.recommendOutfit(userStyle);
        return recommendation;
    }
}

module.exports = VirtualStylistService;
```

In this script, a `VirtualStylistService` class is defined which utilizes the `StylistService`, `UserPreferenceService` and `OutfitRecommendationService` to generate outfit recommendations based on the user's style preferences. The services are represented as separate classes here but in a real-world implementation, these would be actual service classes handling communication with databases, external APIs, or other microservices.

This is a simplified representation and actual professional scripts would also include error handling, validation, logging and potentially much more complex business logic.
