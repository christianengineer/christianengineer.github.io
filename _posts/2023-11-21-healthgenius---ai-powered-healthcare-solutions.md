## machine-learning/models/complex_algorithm.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def complex_ml_algorithm(data_path):
    ## Load mock healthcare data
    data = np.load(data_path)  ## Assuming data is stored in a numpy array file

    ## Split the data into features and target
    X = data[:, :-1]
    y = data[:, -1]

    ## Split data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Initialize and train the complex machine learning model
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=10, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    ## Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    ## Evaluate the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"Accuracy of the complex ML algorithm: {accuracy:.2f}")

    ## Return the trained model for later use
    return model
```

In the provided example, the `complex_ml_algorithm` function implements a complex machine learning algorithm using the `RandomForestClassifier` from scikit-learn. It takes a file path (`data_path`) as input, assuming that the healthcare data is stored in a numpy array file format. The function loads the data, preprocesses it, splits it into training and testing sets, trains the model, makes predictions, evaluates the model's accuracy, and finally returns the trained model for later use.

The function is located in the `machine-learning/models/complex_algorithm.py` file within the HealthGenius repository. The `data_path` parameter represents the file path to the mock healthcare data that the function will utilize for model training and evaluation.

```python
## machine-learning/models/complex_deep_learning.py

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

def complex_deep_learning_algorithm(data_path):
    ## Load mock healthcare data
    data = np.load(data_path)  ## Assuming data is stored in a numpy array file

    ## Split the data into features and target
    X = data[:, :-1]
    y = data[:, -1]

    ## Split data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Preprocess the data
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

    ## Build the deep learning model
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

    ## Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    ## Evaluate the model
    _, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
    print(f"Accuracy of the complex deep learning algorithm: {accuracy:.2f}")

    ## Return the trained model for later use
    return model
```
