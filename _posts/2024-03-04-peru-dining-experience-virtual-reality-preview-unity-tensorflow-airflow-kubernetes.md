Sure! Below is an example of production-ready Python code snippet for cleansing the data for menu items by standardizing image resolution and quality, and preprocessing menu item descriptions for the Peru Dining Experience Virtual Reality Preview project:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfTransformer

# Standardize image resolution and quality for menu item images
def standardize_image(image_path, target_resolution):
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    resized_img = cv2.resize(img, target_resolution)
    return resized_img

# Preprocess menu item descriptions
def preprocess_text(descriptions):
    # Tokenize and count words in descriptions
    count_vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
    bow_matrix = count_vectorizer.fit_transform(descriptions)
    
    # Apply TF-IDF transformation
    tfidf_transformer = TfidfTransformer()
    tfidf_matrix = tfidf_transformer.fit_transform(bow_matrix)
    
    return tfidf_matrix

# Example data
menu_item_images = ['menu_item_image1.jpg', 'menu_item_image2.jpg']
menu_item_descriptions = ['Delicious pasta with creamy sauce', 'Fresh salad with vinaigrette dressing']

# Cleansing data
cleaned_images = [standardize_image(image, (224, 224)) for image in menu_item_images]
cleaned_descriptions = preprocess_text(menu_item_descriptions)

# Verify cleaned data
for img in cleaned_images:
    cv2.imshow('Standardized Image', img)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    
print(cleaned_descriptions)
```
