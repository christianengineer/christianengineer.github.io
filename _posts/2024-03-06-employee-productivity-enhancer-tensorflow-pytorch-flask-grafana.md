from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

## Load the raw data
data = pd.read_csv('employee_data.csv')

## Split data into features and target
X = data.drop('productivity_label', axis=1)  ## Features
y = data['productivity_label']  ## Target

## Step 1: Handle Missing Values
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
X['performance_score'] = imputer.fit_transform(X[['performance_score']])

## Step 2: Encode Categorical Features
encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)
X_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(X[['department', 'job_title']])

## Step 3: Scale Numerical Features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X[['performance_score', 'tenure_in_role']])

## Step 4: Handle Data Imbalance
smote = SMOTE()
X_balanced, y_balanced = smote.fit_resample(X_scaled, y)

## Step 5: Combine Encoded Categorical and Scaled Numerical Features
X_final = np.concatenate((X_encoded, X_balanced), axis=1)

## Print processed data
