   - Extract the unique identifier associated with the customer making the transaction.

5. **Payment Method (payment_method):**
   - Extract the type of payment method used for the transaction.

## Feature Engineering:
1. **Transaction Hour (transaction_hour):**
   - Extract the hour of the day when the transaction took place.

2. **Day of the Week (day_of_week):**
   - Derive the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday) from the transaction timestamp.

3. **Transaction Amount Binned (amount_binned):**
   - Bin the transaction amounts into categories (e.g., low, medium, high) for better model interpretability.
