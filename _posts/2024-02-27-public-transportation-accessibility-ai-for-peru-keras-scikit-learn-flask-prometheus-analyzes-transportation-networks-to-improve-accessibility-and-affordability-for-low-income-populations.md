# AI Public Transportation Accessibility Project Overview

## Objectives:
- To analyze transportation networks in Peru to identify areas where accessibility and affordability can be improved for low-income populations.
- To develop an AI system that leverages Machine Learning models to optimize transportation routes and schedules.
- To create a user-friendly interface (using Flask) for users to access information and recommendations for efficient public transportation options.
- To monitor and gather metrics regarding system performance and user interactions using Prometheus.

## System Design Strategies:
1. **Data Collection and Processing:** Gather data on transportation networks, schedules, and user demographics in Peru. Preprocess and clean the data for training machine learning models.
2. **Machine Learning Modeling** - Use Keras and Scikit-Learn to develop models for optimizing transportation routes, predicting demand, and recommending affordable options for low-income populations.
3. **Flask-based Web Interface:** Create a web application using Flask to display transportation information, route recommendations, and affordability insights to users.
4. **Integration with Prometheus:** Implement monitoring and metric gathering using Prometheus to track system performance, user interactions, and provide feedback for system improvement.

## Chosen Libraries:
1. **Keras:** Utilized for building and training neural networks for various machine learning tasks such as demand prediction, route optimization, and affordability analysis.
2. **Scikit-Learn:** Employed for developing traditional machine learning models like regression, clustering, and classification algorithms for data analysis in the transportation domain.
3. **Flask:** Selected as the web framework for building the user interface to interact with the AI system, enabling users to access transportation recommendations and information.
4. **Prometheus:** Integrated for monitoring system performance and collecting metrics related to user interactions and AI model predictions for continuous system improvement.

By combining these technologies and strategies, the AI Public Transportation Accessibility project aims to revolutionize public transportation in Peru, making it more accessible and affordable for low-income populations through the power of AI and data-driven insights.
