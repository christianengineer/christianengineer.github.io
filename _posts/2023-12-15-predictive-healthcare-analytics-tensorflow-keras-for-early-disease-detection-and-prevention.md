Certainly! Below is an example Python script for training a machine learning model for the Predictive Healthcare Analytics application using mock data. The script utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for model development and is stored in the following file path:

File Path: `models/training/train.py`

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

## Load mock dataset (replace with actual data loading)
## Assume the mock dataset contains features and labels for training
mock_data = pd.read_csv('path_to_mock_data.csv')

## Separate features and labels
X = mock_data.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
y = mock_data['target_variable']

## Split data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Data preprocessing (replace with actual data preprocessing steps)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_val_scaled = scaler.transform(X_val)

## Define a simple sequential model using Keras
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X.shape[1],)),
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_val_scaled, y_val))

## Evaluate the trained model on the validation data
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_val_scaled, y_val)
print(f'Validation accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%')

## Save the trained model and preprocessing scaler
model.save('model_artifacts/model.h5')
joblib.dump(scaler, 'model_artifacts/scaler.pkl')
```

In this example, the train.py script loads mock data, performs data preprocessing, defines a simple neural network model using Keras, trains the model, evaluates its performance, and saves the trained model and preprocessing scaler. This script serves as a starting point for training a machine learning model for early disease detection and prevention in the Predictive Healthcare Analytics application.

Certainly! Below is an example Python script for training a complex machine learning algorithm (specifically a deep learning model) for the Predictive Healthcare Analytics application using mock data. The script utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for model development and is stored in the following file path:

File Path: `models/training/train_complex_model.py`

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, Dropout, BatchNormalization
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

## Load mock dataset (replace with actual data loading)
## Assume the mock dataset contains features and labels for training
mock_data = pd.read_csv('path_to_mock_data.csv')

## Separate features and labels
X = mock_data.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
y = mock_data['target_variable']

## Split data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Data preprocessing (replace with actual data preprocessing steps)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_val_scaled = scaler.transform(X_val)

## Define a complex deep learning model using Keras Functional API
inputs = Input(shape=(X_train_scaled.shape[1],))
x = Dense(128, activation='relu')(inputs)
x = BatchNormalization()(x)
x = Dropout(0.5)(x)
x = Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)
x = BatchNormalization()(x)
x = Dropout(0.5)(x)
outputs = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(x)

model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=64, validation_data=(X_val_scaled, y_val))

## Evaluate the trained model on the validation data
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_val_scaled, y_val)
print(f'Validation accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%')

## Save the trained model and preprocessing scaler
model.save('model_artifacts/complex_model.h5')
joblib.dump(scaler, 'model_artifacts/scaler.pkl')
```

In this example, the train_complex_model.py script loads mock data, performs data preprocessing, defines a complex deep learning model using the Keras Functional API, trains the model, evaluates its performance, and saves the trained model and preprocessing scaler. This script serves as a starting point for training a complex machine learning algorithm for early disease detection and prevention in the Predictive Healthcare Analytics application.
