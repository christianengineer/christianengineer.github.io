## AI HumanAI for HR Management Repository

### Objectives
The AI HumanAI repository aims to develop a scalable, data-intensive AI application for HR management. The overarching objective is to leverage machine learning and deep learning techniques to optimize HR processes and decision-making. This involves automating tasks such as candidate screening, employee performance evaluation, and talent management.

### System Design Strategies
1. **Scalability**: Design the application to handle large volumes of HR data, such as resumes, employee records, and performance metrics. Utilize distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark to process and analyze data at scale.
2. **Modularity**: Divide the application into microservices to enable independent development and deployment of HR functionalities, such as recruitment, learning and development, and performance management.
3. **Data Pipeline**: Implement robust data pipelines for data ingestion, processing, and transformation. Utilize tools like Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming and Apache Nifi for data flow management.
4. **Machine Learning Infrastructure**: Integrate a scalable machine learning infrastructure using tools like TensorFlow Extended (TFX) to facilitate end-to-end ML pipeline development, from data ingestion to model serving.

### Chosen Libraries
1. **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow will be used for building and training deep learning models for various HR use cases, such as candidate matching, sentiment analysis in employee feedback, and predictive attrition analysis.
2. **Scikit-learn**: Scikit-learn will be utilized for traditional machine learning tasks, such as classification and clustering for candidate assessment and employee segmentation.
3. **Apache Spark**: Apache Spark will be employed for distributed data processing and analysis to handle large-scale HR data efficiently.
4. **Flask**: Flask will be used to build RESTful APIs for the microservices, enabling seamless integration with the front-end and external systems.
5. **Kafka and Nifi**: Apache Kafka and Apache Nifi will be used for real-time data streaming and data flow management to support real-time analytics and decision-making.

By combining these system design strategies and chosen libraries, we can develop a highly scalable, data-intensive AI application for HR management that leverages machine learning and deep learning to enhance HR processes and decision-making.

It defines the infrastructure resources, such as virtual machines, networking components, and storage services, and specifies the desired state of the infrastructure.
- `variables.tf`: The `variables.tf` file declares the input variables used within the Terraform configuration, allowing for parameterization and customization of the infrastructure provisioning process.

By organizing deployment-related files within the `deployment` directory, the application ensures a clear separation of concerns and facilitates the implementation of deployment automation and infrastructure as code practices. This structure enables efficient and consistent deployment of the HumanAI AI for HR Management application across different environments, such as local development environments, staging environments, and production environments.

Certainly! Below is a Python function for a complex machine learning algorithm within the HumanAI AI for HR Management application. This function demonstrates a hypothetical talent management model using mock data. The algorithm utilizes the Scikit-learn library to create a random forest classifier and perform predictive modeling for talent management.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def talent_management_ml_algorithm(data_file_path):
    # Load mock HR data
    hr_data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, encode categorical variables)

    # Split the data into features and target variable
    X = hr_data.drop('talent_class', axis=1)  # Features
    y = hr_data['talent_class']  # Target variable

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize and train a random forest classifier
    rf_classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    rf_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    y_pred = rf_classifier.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    return rf_classifier, accuracy
```

In this example:
- The function `talent_management_ml_algorithm` accepts a file path to the mock HR data file as input.
- It loads the HR data using pandas and performs data preprocessing (which is not explicitly shown in the example).
- The data is split into features (X) and the target variable (y) for training the model.
- A random forest classifier is initialized, trained on the training data, and used to make predictions on the testing data.
- The accuracy of the model is evaluated using the testing data, and the trained model and accuracy score are returned as results.

The file path for the mock data should be passed as an argument when calling the function. For example:
```python
data_file_path = 'path_to_mock_data/mock_hr_data.csv'
trained_model, accuracy = talent_management_ml_algorithm(data_file_path)
print("Model trained with accuracy:", accuracy)
```

The actual data file path should point to the location of the mock HR data CSV file within the application's data directory.

Certainly! Below is a Python function for a complex deep learning algorithm within the HumanAI AI for HR Management application. This function demonstrates a hypothetical deep learning model for sentiment analysis in employee feedback, utilizing TensorFlow and Keras to create a multi-layer neural network for text classification.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

def employee_feedback_sentiment_analysis_dl_algorithm(data_file_path):
    # Load mock HR feedback data
    feedback_data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Preprocess the text data (e.g., tokenization, padding)

    # Split the data into features (feedback) and target variable (sentiment)
    X = feedback_data['feedback']
    y = feedback_data['sentiment']

    # Tokenize the feedback data and convert to sequences
    tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=1000, oov_token='<OOV>')
    tokenizer.fit_on_texts(X)
    X_sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(X)
    X_padded = pad_sequences(X_sequences, maxlen=100, truncating='post')

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_padded, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize a sequential model
    model = Sequential([
        Embedding(input_dim=1000, output_dim=64, input_length=100),
        LSTM(64, return_sequences=True),
        LSTM(32),
        Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    
    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    return model
```

In this example:
- The function `employee_feedback_sentiment_analysis_dl_algorithm` accepts a file path to the mock employee feedback data file as input.
- It loads the feedback data using pandas and performs text preprocessing and tokenization using TensorFlow's Keras preprocessing functionalities.
- The data is split into text features (feedback) and the target variable (sentiment) for sentiment analysis.
- A sequential deep learning model with layers for embedding, LSTM, and dense connections is defined and compiled using Keras.
- The model is trained on the training data using the feedback text and corresponding sentiment labels.

The file path for the mock data should be passed as an argument when calling the function. For example:
```python
data_file_path = 'path_to_mock_data/mock_employee_feedback.csv'
trained_dl_model = employee_feedback_sentiment_analysis_dl_algorithm(data_file_path)
```

The actual data file path should point to the location of the mock employee feedback data CSV file within the application's data directory.
