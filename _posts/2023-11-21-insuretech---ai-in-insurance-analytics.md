```python
# src/ai/modeling/complex_algorithm.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def complex_machine_learning_algorithm(data_path):
    """
    Function to demonstrate a complex machine learning algorithm using mock data.

    Args:
    - data_path (str): File path to the input data

    Returns:
    - float: Accuracy of the trained model
    """
    # Load mock data from the provided file path
    data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

    # Extract features and target variable
    X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = data['target']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize and train the model (Random Forest Classifier as an example)
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Calculate accuracy of the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    return accuracy
```

In this example, I have created a function `complex_machine_learning_algorithm` within the `modeling` module of the `ai` package. The function reads mock data from a specified file path, performs feature extraction, trains a Random Forest Classifier model, evaluates the model's accuracy, and returns the accuracy score. This function demonstrates a complex machine learning algorithm using a standard supervised learning approach.

The file path where the mock data is stored should be provided as an argument to the function. This function can serve as a placeholder for a more complex machine learning algorithm to be implemented as part of the InsureTech - AI in Insurance Analytics application.

```python
# src/ai/modeling/deep_learning_algorithm.py

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

def complex_deep_learning_algorithm(data_path):
    """
    Function to demonstrate a complex deep learning algorithm using mock data.

    Args:
    - data_path (str): File path to the input data

    Returns:
    - float: Accuracy of the trained deep learning model
    """
    # Load mock data from the provided file path
    data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

    # Extract features and target variable
    X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = data['target']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Standardize the input features
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

    # Define the deep learning model architecture using TensorFlow/Keras
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test_scaled, y_test))

    # Evaluate the model
    _, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test_scaled, y_test)

    return accuracy
```

In this function, `complex_deep_learning_algorithm`, I have demonstrated a complex deep learning algorithm using a mock dataset. The function uses TensorFlow and Keras to define a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network architecture, and it trains the model to predict the target variable based on the input features. The function loads mock data from a specified file path, preprocesses the data, defines and trains a deep learning model, and evaluates the model's accuracy.

Similar to the machine learning example, the file path to the mock data is passed as an argument to the function. This function serves as a placeholder for a more complex deep learning algorithm to be implemented as part of the InsureTech - AI in Insurance Analytics application.
