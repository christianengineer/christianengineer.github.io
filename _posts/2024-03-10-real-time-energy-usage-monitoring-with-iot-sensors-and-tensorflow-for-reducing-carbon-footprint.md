  - *Project Component*: The `preprocessed_data.csv` file contains the preprocessed dataset used for training the LSTM model.

### 4. Sustainability Manager
- **User Story**:
  - *Scenario*: As a Sustainability Manager, I am tasked with reducing the building's carbon footprint but lack real-time insights into energy usage.
  - *Solution*: The application's real-time energy monitoring capabilities enable me to track energy consumption patterns and implement proactive sustainability measures.
  - *Benefit*: By utilizing the application's IoT sensor data and predictive analytics, I can identify areas for improvement, implement energy-saving initiatives, and contribute to the building's environmental goals.
  - *Project Component*: The Flask API (`main.py`) provides access to real-time energy usage data and model predictions for sustainability planning.

By identifying diverse user groups and creating user stories that illustrate the specific pain points addressed by the application, the real-time Energy Usage Monitoring project demonstrates its value proposition in helping users track and optimize energy consumption, reduce costs, and work towards sustainability objectives in commercial buildings.
