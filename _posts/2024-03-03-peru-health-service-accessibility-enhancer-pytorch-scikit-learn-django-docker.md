I'll provide an example of a Python script for training a PyTorch model using mock data for the Peru Health Service Accessibility Enhancer project. 

```python
# File Path: ml_model/pytorch_model/train_mock_data.py

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Mock data for training (example data)
X_train = torch.tensor([[0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5], [0.6, 0.7]])
y_train = torch.tensor([0, 1, 0])

# Define the PyTorch model architecture
class Model(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Model, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(2, 1)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.sigmoid(self.fc(x))

model = Model()
criterion = nn.BCELoss()  # Binary Cross Entropy Loss
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training the model
for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(X_train.float())
    loss = criterion(outputs.squeeze(), y_train.float())
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    if epoch % 10 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}')

# Save the trained model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'ml_model/pytorch_model/trained_model.pth')
```

This Python script trains a simple PyTorch model using mock data, defines the model architecture, sets up the loss function and optimizer, and runs the training loop for a specified number of epochs. It then saves the trained model to a file named `trained_model.pth` in the `ml_model/pytorch_model/` directory.

This script serves as an example and can be further customized and extended with actual data and a more complex model tailored to the Peru Health Service Accessibility Enhancer project's requirements.

I'll provide an example of a Python script for training a complex machine learning algorithm (Random Forest Classifier) using Scikit-Learn with mock data for the Peru Health Service Accessibility Enhancer project.

```python
# File Path: ml_model/scikit-learn_model/train_complex_algorithm_mock_data.py

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Mock data for training (example data)
X = [[0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5], [0.6, 0.7]]
y = [0, 1, 0]

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define and train the Random Forest Classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Calculate and print the accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')

# Save the trained model (not needed for Random Forest)
```

This Python script trains a Random Forest Classifier using Scikit-Learn with mock data, splits the data into training and testing sets, trains the model, makes predictions on the test set, calculates the accuracy, and prints the results.

Please note that for the Random Forest Classifier, there is no need to save the trained model as it can be used directly for prediction. This script can be further customized and extended with more sophisticated algorithms or additional data processing steps tailored to the Peru Health Service Accessibility Enhancer project's requirements.
