## AI Traffic Accident Prevention Analysis (Scikit-Learn, OpenCV) For Safer Roads

### Objectives
The primary objective of the AI Traffic Accident Prevention Analysis project is to develop a scalable, data-intensive AI application that utilizes machine learning to analyze real-time traffic data and predict potential accidents. This aims to contribute to safer roads by providing early warnings and insights to traffic management authorities, helping them take preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of accidents.

### System Design Strategies

## MLOps Infrastructure for Traffic Accident Prevention Analysis

Building a robust MLOps infrastructure for the Traffic Accident Prevention Analysis application is crucial for ensuring the scalability, reliability, and efficiency of the machine learning models and real-time analysis processes.

### Components of MLOps Infrastructure

1. **Data Pipeline**:
