Below is an example of a Python script for training a machine learning model for the Automated Vaccine Distribution Planning application using mock data. The file is named "train_model.py" and is placed in the "models" directory of the project.

```python
## File Path: automated-vaccine-distribution/models/train_model.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import joblib

## Mock data generation
np.random.seed(0)
X = np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = 2 + 3 * X + np.random.rand(100, 1)

## Split mock data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Initialize and train the machine learning model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Evaluate the model
r2_score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"R-squared (R2) score: {r2_score}")

## Save the trained model to a file
model_filename = 'linear_regression_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, model_filename)
print(f"Trained model saved to {model_filename}")
```

In this example, the script generates mock data, splits it into training and testing sets, and trains a simple linear regression model using Scikit-Learn. The trained model is then evaluated and saved to a file using joblib.

This "train_model.py" file can be used as a starting point for training machine learning models for the Automated Vaccine Distribution Planning application. It demonstrates the process of training a model using mock data and can be extended to incorporate real-world data and more complex machine learning algorithms to address the healthcare application's needs.

Below is an example of a Python script for training a complex machine learning algorithm (a neural network) for the Automated Vaccine Distribution Planning application using mock data. The file is named "train_complex_model.py" and is placed in the "models" directory of the project.

```python
## File Path: automated-vaccine-distribution/models/train_complex_model.py

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
import joblib

## Mock data generation
np.random.seed(0)
X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

## Split mock data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Define the neural network model
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

## Evaluate the model
_, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")

## Save the trained model to a file
model_filename = 'neural_network_model.h5'
model.save(model_filename)
print(f"Trained model saved to {model_filename}")
```

In this example, the script uses TensorFlow to define and train a neural network model using mock data. The model is compiled, trained, evaluated, and then saved to a file. This "train_complex_model.py" file can serve as a starting point for training more complex machine learning algorithms, leveraging the capabilities of TensorFlow to address the specific needs of the Automated Vaccine Distribution Planning application.
