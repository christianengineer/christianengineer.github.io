Sure, here's an example file for training a sentiment analysis model using mock data for the Accessible Mental Health Resources application. This file assumes that you have a dataset of text data and a pre-defined model architecture for sentiment analysis using TensorFlow.

### File: train_sentiment_analysis_model.py
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

## Mock data (replace with actual data)
texts = ["I feel so stressed out today", "Feeling great after the therapy session", "Anxious about the upcoming events", "The support group was really helpful"]

## Mock labels (replace with actual labels)
labels = [1, 0, 1, 0]  ## 1 for positive sentiment, 0 for negative sentiment

## Preprocessing the text data
tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=1000, oov_token='<OOV>')
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(texts)
sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(texts)
padded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=100, padding='post')

## Define the sentiment analysis model
model = Sequential([
    Embedding(input_dim=1000, output_dim=16, input_length=100),
    LSTM(64),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
model.fit(padded_sequences, labels, epochs=10, validation_split=0.2)

## Save the trained model
model.save('models/trained/sentiment_analysis/model_v1')
```

In this example, the file `train_sentiment_analysis_model.py` trains a simple sentiment analysis model using TensorFlow, with a mock dataset of text data and corresponding labels. The trained model is then saved in the specified file path: `models/trained/sentiment_analysis/model_v1`.

You can replace the mock data with your actual dataset and modify the model architecture and training process as per your specific requirements. After training the model, you can use it for sentiment analysis within the Accessible Mental Health Resources application.

Certainly! Below is an example of a file for implementing a complex machine learning algorithm, such as a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN), using TensorFlow for the Accessible Mental Health Resources application. This example uses mock data for illustration purposes.

### File: train_hierarchical_rnn_model.py
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Embedding, LSTM, Dense, Bidirectional, TimeDistributed
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
import numpy as np

## Mock data and labels (replace with actual data and labels)
num_users = 1000
max_conversations_per_user = 50
max_words_per_conversation = 100
num_classes = 5

## Generate mock conversation data
conversation_data = np.random.randint(1000, size=(num_users, max_conversations_per_user, max_words_per_conversation))

## Generate mock labels
labels = np.random.randint(num_classes, size=(num_users,))

## Define the hierarchical RNN model
input_layer = Input(shape=(max_conversations_per_user, max_words_per_conversation))
word_embedding = TimeDistributed(Embedding(input_dim=10000, output_dim=100, input_length=max_words_per_conversation))(input_layer)
conversation_encoder = TimeDistributed(LSTM(64))(word_embedding)
user_encoder = LSTM(128)(conversation_encoder)
output_layer = Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(user_encoder)

model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model with mock data
model.fit(conversation_data, labels, epochs=10, validation_split=0.2)

## Save the trained model
model.save('models/trained/hierarchical_rnn_model')
```

In this example, the file `train_hierarchical_rnn_model.py` implements a hierarchical RNN model using TensorFlow, with mock conversation data and corresponding user labels. The trained model is then saved in the specified file path: `models/trained/hierarchical_rnn_model`.

You can replace the mock data with your actual dataset and modify the model architecture and training process based on the specific requirements of the Accessible Mental Health Resources application. This example demonstrates a more complex machine learning algorithm that can be used for processing user conversations and providing personalized support within the application.
