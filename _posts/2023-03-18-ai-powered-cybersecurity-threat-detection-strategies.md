# AI-Based Cybersecurity Threat Detection Repository

## Description 
The AI-Based Cybersecurity Threat Detection repository is focused on the development and deployment of a scalable, AI-powered predictive model to detect, classify and mitigate cybersecurity threats in real-time. This advanced system will perform extensive data analysis and pattern recognition on network traffic, looking for anomalies that suggest potential security threats. 

This repository houses critical data, machine-learning models, algorithms, libraries, and technical documentation necessary for the development, testing, implementation, and updating of this cybersecurity threat detection system. Included in its architecture will be a state-of-the-art, user-friendly interactive dashboard that offers real-time alerts and insights about the security status.

## Goals 
1. **Efficient Data Handling**: Implement AI and machine learning algorithms to process huge volumes of data generated from different network endpoints efficiently.
2. **Real-time Threat Detection**: Leverage predictive analytics and machine learning to detect cybersecurity threats in real-time and take immediate remedial action.
3. **Predictive Analysis**: Develop mechanisms for accurate forecasting of potential future security threats based on historical data.
4. **Scalability**: Ensure that the system is able to expand comfortably with increasing data loads and user traffic.
5. **User-friendly Interface**: Design an intuitive, easy-to-navigate dashboard that enables users to interact effectively with the system.

## Libraries
1. **TensorFlow and Keras**: These will be used to build and train our neural networks for threat detection and predictive analysis.
2. **Scikit-learn**: This library will assist in building machine learning models and facilitate various tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering.
3. **Pandas and NumPy**: These libraries provide high-performance data manipulation and analysis capabilities, crucial for handling large datasets.
4. **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: These libraries will help in creating dynamic visualizations.
5. **Flask or Django**: These will help in building and scaling the user interface of our application.
6. **psycopg2 or SQLAlchemy**: These will facilitate connections to databases for structured storage and retrieval of data. 

This system will use logs and traffic patterns to identify anomalies, assess risk levels and predict potential threats. By leveraging advanced AI capabilities, we aim to advance cybersecurity and keep data safe and secure.


Here's a proposed structure for the repository that supports scaling.

## Structure Breakdown:

- **data/**: Stores raw data from various sources, processed data, and output from the models.
- **libraries/**: Holds external libraries used as well as custom-built libraries.
- **models/**: Contains old and current AI/ML models.
- **scripts/**: Includes scripts for preprocessing, training, evaluation, and predictive inference.
- **visualizations/**: Houses all types of visualizations - both static and interactive.
- **application/**: Contains frontend and backend of the application including user interfaces.
- **tests/**: Includes unit tests, integration tests to ensure code integrity.
- **docs/**: Contains all vital documentation - design docs, user manuals, and technical guides.
- **Readme.md**: Provides an overview and instructions for the project.


This structure aims to ensure easy navigation and improved readability as the repository grows larger and more complex.

# AI-Based Cybersecurity Threat Detection Repository Structure

Consider the following structure:

```
AI-Based Cybersecurity Threat Detection/
├── scripts/
│   ├── preprocessing/
│   ├── training/
│   ├── evaluation/
│   └── detection_logic.py
└── Readme.md
```

In this structure, `detection_logic.py` is a fictitious file  that handles the logic for our AI-Based Cybersecurity Threat Detection.

Here's an abstract example (in Python) of how the detection logic might look:

```python
# detection_logic.py
# Note: This is a simplified pseudocode logic for educational purposes.

# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
import numpy as np

# Load trained model
model = np.load('models/current/model.npy')

# Function to preprocess incoming data
def preprocess(data_path):
    data = pd.read_csv(data_path)
    # Preprocessing steps here
    # ...
    return processed_data

# Function to detect anomalies in preprocessed data
def detect(processed_data):
    predictions = model.predict(processed_data)
    anomalies = processed_data[predictions == -1]
    return anomalies

# Main function
def main():
    data_path = "data/raw/incoming_data.csv"
    processed_data = preprocess(data_path)
    anomalies = detect(processed_data)
    if len(anomalies) > 0:
        print("Potential Threat Detected!")
        print(anomalies)
    else:
        print("No Threats Detected.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script represents a simple outline for a threat detection logic. When run, the script loads a model, processes incoming data, and uses the model to predict whether or not each piece of data represents a cyber threat. As the system develops, this script would become far more complex, incorporating real-time detection, anomaly scoring, alert management, and more.
