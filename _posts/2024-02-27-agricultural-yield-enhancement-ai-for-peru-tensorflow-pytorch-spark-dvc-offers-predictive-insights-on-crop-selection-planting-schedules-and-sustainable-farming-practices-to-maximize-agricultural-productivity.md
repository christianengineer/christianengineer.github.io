from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
import joblib

# Load mock data
data_path = "../data/processed_data/mock_data.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

# Split data into features (X) and target (y)
X = data.drop('yield', axis=1)
y = data['yield']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
