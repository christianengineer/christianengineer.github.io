The `deployment` directory organizes the necessary files and configurations for deploying the Smart Traffic Management System using Docker containers or Kubernetes orchestration. This structured approach streamlines the deployment process and ensures consistency and portability across diverse deployment environments. Furthermore, it provides clear documentation and guidelines for deploying and managing the application's infrastructure.

Certainly! Below is an example Python script `train_model.py` that utilizes Scikit-Learn to train a mock traffic flow prediction model. The script takes mock data from a CSV file, preprocesses the data, trains the model, and saves the trained model to a file.

#### train_model.py
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
import joblib

# Load mock traffic flow data from a CSV file
data_file = 'data/raw/traffic_data.csv'
traffic_data = pd.read_csv(data_file)

# Perform feature engineering and preprocessing
# ...

# Split the data into features and target variable
X = traffic_data.drop(['target_column'], axis=1)
y = traffic_data['target_column']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a random forest regressor model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
# ...

# Save the trained model to a file
model_file = 'models/trained_models/traffic_flow_prediction.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, model_file)
```

In this example, the script `train_model.py` reads mock traffic data from a CSV file, preprocesses the data, trains a RandomForestRegressor model using Scikit-Learn, evaluates the model, and finally saves the trained model to a file located at `models/trained_models/traffic_flow_prediction.pkl`.

This script serves as a basic example for training a traffic flow prediction model using mock data and is a fundamental step in the Smart Traffic Management System's machine learning pipeline.

Certainly! Below is an example Python script `complex_ml_algorithm.py` that demonstrates the usage of a complex machine learning algorithm (in this case, a Gradient Boosting Regressor) for the Smart Traffic Management System. The script utilizes Scikit-Learn to train the model using mock traffic data and saves the trained model to a file.

#### complex_ml_algorithm.py
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import joblib

# Load mock traffic flow data from a CSV file
data_file = 'data/raw/traffic_data.csv'
traffic_data = pd.read_csv(data_file)

# Feature engineering and data preprocessing
# ...

# Split the data into features and target variable
X = traffic_data.drop(['target_column'], axis=1)
y = traffic_data['target_column']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Gradient Boosting Regressor model
model = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
# ...

# Save the trained model to a file
model_file = 'models/trained_models/complex_traffic_flow_prediction_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, model_file)
```

In this example, the script `complex_ml_algorithm.py` demonstrates the usage of the Gradient Boosting Regressor algorithm to train a complex machine learning model for traffic flow prediction. The trained model is then saved to a file located at `models/trained_models/complex_traffic_flow_prediction_model.pkl`.

This script showcases the implementation of a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm using mock traffic data and is an essential component of the Smart Traffic Management System for urban planning.
