I will provide an example file for training a model using mock data for the Intelligent Public Transport Planner application in Callao, Peru. Let's create a file named `train_model.py` under the `src/` directory in the project repository:

```python
# File: src/train_model.py
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.optimizers import Adam

# Load mock data
data = {
    'feature1': np.random.random(1000),
    'feature2': np.random.random(1000),
    'target': np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Split data into features and target
X = df[['feature1', 'feature2']]
y = df['target']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define and train a simple neural network model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(128, input_shape=(2,), activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Save the trained model
model.save('models/saved_models/mock_model.h5')
```

In this file:
- Mock data is generated for training a simple neural network model.

from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout
from keras.optimizers import Adam

# Load mock data
data = {
    'feature1': np.random.random(1000),
    'feature2': np.random.random(1000),
    'feature3': np.random.random(1000),
    'target': np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Split data into features and target
X = df[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']]
y = df['target']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define and train a complex neural network model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(128, input_shape=(3,), activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.2))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Save the trained model
