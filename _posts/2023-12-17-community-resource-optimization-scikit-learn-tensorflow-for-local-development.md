- **Environment Variables**: Scripts for managing environment variables and configuration settings necessary for the deployment of Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow models within local development environments.

By incorporating the `deployment/` directory and its associated deployment scripts, the Community Resource Optimization repository can provide a structured approach for deploying trained Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow models, streamlining the process of making AI models available for inference within local development environments. This approach promotes consistency, ease of deployment, and effective utilization of AI models within the development repository.

Certainly! Below is an example of a file for training a model using mock data for the Community Resource Optimization repository. We'll include a sample Python file for training a simple linear regression model using both Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow. The file is named `train_model.py` and is located within the `models/scikit-learn/` directory.

### File Path: `models/scikit-learn/train_model.py`

```python
## models/scikit-learn/train_model.py

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

## Mock data (replace with actual data)
X_train = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 3]])
y_train = np.dot(X_train, np.array([1, 2])) + 3

## Instantiate the model
model = LinearRegression()

## Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Evaluate the trained model
score = model.score(X_train, y_train)
print(f"R-squared score: {score}")
```

In this script, we import the `LinearRegression` model from Scikit-Learn and use mock data for training the model. The trained model is then evaluated using the R-squared score. This script serves as an example for training a simple linear regression model using Scikit-Learn.

For TensorFlow, a similar script would be created using TensorFlow's APIs for constructing and training a model with mock data. This script would be located at `models/tensorflow/train_model.py`.

This structure allows for separate training scripts for Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow models, contributing to the organization and modularity of the development repository.

Certainly! Below is an example of a file for implementing a complex machine learning algorithm using mock data for the Community Resource Optimization repository. We'll include a sample Python file for implementing a Random Forest classifier using Scikit-Learn. The file is named `random_forest_model.py` and is located within the `models/scikit-learn/` directory.

### File Path: `models/scikit-learn/random_forest_model.py`

```python
## models/scikit-learn/random_forest_model.py

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

## Generate mock data (replace with actual data loading)
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_classes=2, random_state=42)

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Instantiate the Random Forest classifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

## Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

## Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy of the Random Forest classifier: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

In this script, we use the `RandomForestClassifier` from Scikit-Learn and generate mock classification data. The model is trained and then evaluated using the accuracy score. This script serves as an example for implementing a complex machine learning algorithm using Scikit-Learn.

For TensorFlow, a similar script would be created using TensorFlow's APIs for constructing and training a complex neural network model with mock data. This script would be located at `models/tensorflow/complex_model.py`.

This structure allows for separate script files for implementing complex machine learning algorithms for Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow models, contributing to the organization and modularity of the development repository.
