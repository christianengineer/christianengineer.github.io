Sure, here's an example of a file for training a model using mock data for the Fair Lending Analysis Tools repository. This file will be used to train a Scikit-Learn model for combating financial biases.

```python
# File Path: fair-lending-analysis/src/model_training/train_scikit_model.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
import joblib

# Load mock lending data
mock_lending_data_path = 'data/processed/mock_lending_data.csv'
lending_df = pd.read_csv(mock_lending_data_path)

# Preprocessing and feature engineering
# ... (preprocessing steps such as encoding categorical variables, feature selection, etc.)

# Split data into features and target variable
X = lending_df.drop('target_column', axis=1)
y = lending_df['target_column']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the fairness-aware Scikit-Learn model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')

# Generate and store model metrics
model_metrics = classification_report(y_test, y_pred, output_dict=True)

# Save the trained model
model_output_path = 'models/scikit-learn/fairness_aware_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, model_output_path)

# Save model metrics to a JSON file
import json
model_metrics_path = 'models/scikit-learn/scikit_model_metrics.json'
with open(model_metrics_path, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(model_metrics, f)

# Save model config
model_config = {
    'model_type': 'RandomForestClassifier',
    'estimators': 100,
    'preprocessing_steps': '...',
    'fairness_constraints': '...'
}
model_config_path = 'models/scikit-learn/scikit_model_config.yml'
import yaml
with open(model_config_path, 'w') as file:
    documents = yaml.dump(model_config, file)
```

In this example, the file `train_scikit_model.py` within the `src/model_training/` directory of the Fair Lending Analysis Tools repository trains a Scikit-Learn Random Forest model using mock lending data. The file-path where this script is located would be `fair-lending-analysis/src/model_training/train_scikit_model.py`. This script includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and storage of the trained model, metrics, and configuration.

Certainly! Below is an example of a file for training a complex machine learning algorithm, specifically a deep learning model using TensorFlow, for the Fair Lending Analysis Tools repository. This file will be used to train a TensorFlow model for combating financial biases.

```python
# File Path: fair-lending-analysis/src/model_training/train_complex_tensorflow_model.py

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import joblib

# Load mock lending data
mock_lending_data_path = 'data/processed/mock_lending_data.csv'
lending_df = pd.read_csv(mock_lending_data_path)

# Preprocessing and feature engineering
# ... (preprocessing steps such as encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, etc.)

# Split data into features and target variable
X = lending_df.drop('target_column', axis=1)
y = lending_df['target_column']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Feature Scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Create a complex deep learning model using TensorFlow
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=64, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Evaluate model performance
_, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')

# Save the trained model
model_output_path = 'models/tensorflow/complex_deep_learning_model.h5'
model.save(model_output_path)

# Save model metrics to a JSON file
model_metrics = {
    'accuracy': accuracy,
    'loss': 'binary_crossentropy',
    'optimizer': 'adam',
    'epochs': 10
}
model_metrics_path = 'models/tensorflow/tensorflow_model_metrics.json'
import json
with open(model_metrics_path, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(model_metrics, f)

# Save model config
model_config = {
    'model_type': 'DeepLearning',
    'layers': ['Dense(128, activation="relu")', 'Dense(64, activation="relu")', 'Dense(1, activation="sigmoid")'],
    'optimizer': 'adam',
    'loss_function': 'binary_crossentropy',
    'preprocessing_steps': 'StandardScaler'
}
model_config_path = 'models/tensorflow/tensorflow_model_config.yml'
import yaml
with open(model_config_path, 'w') as file:
    documents = yaml.dump(model_config, file)
```

In this example, the file `train_complex_tensorflow_model.py` within the `src/model_training/` directory of the Fair Lending Analysis Tools repository trains a complex deep learning model using TensorFlow with mock lending data. The file path where this script is located would be `fair-lending-analysis/src/model_training/train_complex_tensorflow_model.py`.
