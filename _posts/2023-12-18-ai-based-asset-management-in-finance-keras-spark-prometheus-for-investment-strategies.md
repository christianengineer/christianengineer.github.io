Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a Keras model using mock data for the AI-based Asset Management in Finance application. The script assumes the presence of mock data in CSV format.

### File: `model_training_keras.py`

```python
import pandas as pd
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

## Load mock financial data
data = pd.read_csv('data/raw/financial_data.csv')

## Data preprocessing
## ... (Data preprocessing steps such as feature engineering, normalization, etc.)

## Split data into features and target
X = data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']].values
y = data['target'].values

## Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Scale the input features
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

## Define the LSTM model
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2])))
model.add(LSTM(50, return_sequences=False))
model.add(Dense(25))
model.add(Dense(1))

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

## Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

## Save the trained model
model.save('models/keras/lstm_stock_prediction.h5')
```

In this example, the script `model_training_keras.py` loads mock financial data in CSV format, preprocesses the data, defines and trains an LSTM-based model for stock price prediction using Keras, and saves the trained model to the `models/keras` directory.

The file path for the dataset is assumed to be: `data/raw/financial_data.csv`. The location for the trained model is `models/keras/lstm_stock_prediction.h5`.

This script serves as a sample for training a Keras model using mock data and can be further extended based on specific preprocessing and model requirements for the AI-based Asset Management in Finance application.

### File: `complex_model_training_spark.py`

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
from pyspark.ml.regression import GBTRegressor
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import RegressionEvaluator
from pyspark.ml import Pipeline
import pandas as pd

## Create a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("AssetManagementFinance").getOrCreate()

## Load mock financial data
data = spark.read.csv("data/raw/financial_data.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)

## Data preprocessing
## ... (Data preprocessing steps such as feature engineering, handling missing values, etc.)

## Define features and target variable
feature_cols = ['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")
data = assembler.transform(data)
data = data.select("features", "target")

## Split the data into training and testing sets
train_data, test_data = data.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2])

## Define the GBTRegressor model
gbt = GBTRegressor(featuresCol='features', labelCol='target', maxIter=10)

## Create a pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[gbt])

## Train the model
model = pipeline.fit(train_data)

## Make predictions
predictions = model.transform(test_data)

## Evaluate the model
evaluator = RegressionEvaluator(labelCol="target", predictionCol="prediction", metricName="rmse")
rmse = evaluator.evaluate(predictions)
print("Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on test data = %g" % rmse)

## Save the trained model
model.save("models/spark/complex_regression_model")
```

In this example, the script `complex_model_training_spark.py` loads mock financial data using Spark, preprocesses the data, defines and trains a complex Gradient-Boosted Tree regression model using Spark MLlib, and saves the trained model to the `models/spark` directory.

The file path for the dataset is assumed to be: `data/raw/financial_data.csv`. The location for the trained model is `models/spark/complex_regression_model`.

This script serves as an example for training a complex machine learning algorithm using Spark MLlib with mock data and can be extended based on specific requirements for the AI-based Asset Management in Finance application.
