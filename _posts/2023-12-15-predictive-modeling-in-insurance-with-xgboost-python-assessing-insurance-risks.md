Here's an example of a Python script for training a model for the Predictive Modeling in Insurance with XGBoost application using mock data. In this example, the script assumes the availability of mock data in a CSV format for demonstration purposes. Below is the content of the training script along with the file path:

**File Path**: `src/train_model.py`

```python
# src/train_model.py

import pandas as pd
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
import joblib

# Load mock data
mock_data_path = 'data/mock_insurance_data.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(mock_data_path)

# Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering
# ... (code for data preprocessing and feature engineering)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X = data.drop('target_column', axis=1)  # Replace 'target_column' with the actual target column name
y = data['target_column']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the XGBoost model
model = xgb.XGBClassifier(objective='binary:logistic', max_depth=3, learning_rate=0.1, n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions and evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print('Accuracy:', accuracy)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Save the trained model
model_path = 'models/xgboost_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, model_path)
print('Trained model saved at', model_path)
```

In this script, the mock data is assumed to be located in the file `data/mock_insurance_data.csv`, and the trained model is saved in the `models/` directory as `xgboost_model.pkl`.

This script demonstrates a simplistic training process, and in a real-world scenario, it would be essential to incorporate more robust data preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation techniques to train a high-quality predictive model for assessing insurance risks using XGBoost.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a complex machine learning algorithm, specifically a Random Forest Classifier, for the Predictive Modeling in Insurance with XGBoost application using mock data. In this example, the script assumes the availability of mock data in a CSV format for demonstration purposes. 

**File Path**: `src/train_complex_model.py`
```python
# src/train_complex_model.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score
import joblib

# Load mock data
mock_data_path = 'data/mock_insurance_data.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(mock_data_path)

# Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering
# ... (code for data preprocessing and feature engineering)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X = data.drop('target_column', axis=1)  # Replace 'target_column' with the actual target column name
y = data['target_column']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Random Forest Classifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=10, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions and evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print('Accuracy:', accuracy)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Save the trained model
model_path = 'models/random_forest_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, model_path)
print('Trained model saved at', model_path)
```

In this script, the mock data is assumed to be located in the file `data/mock_insurance_data.csv`, and the trained model is saved in the `models/` directory as `random_forest_model.pkl`.

This script represents a more advanced example that uses a Random Forest Classifier for training a predictive model. As with the previous example, in a real-world scenario, it would be essential to incorporate comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation procedures for the development of a robust predictive modeling solution.
