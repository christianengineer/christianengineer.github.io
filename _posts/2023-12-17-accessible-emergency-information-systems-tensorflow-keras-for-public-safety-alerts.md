File Path: `machine-learning/models/tensorflow/public-safety-alerts/training/train_model.py`

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

## Generate mock training data
num_samples = 1000
input_dim = 10
output_dim = 2

X_train = np.random.rand(num_samples, input_dim)
y_train = np.random.randint(output_dim, size=num_samples)

## Define and compile the neural network model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_dim, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model with the mock data
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

## Save the trained model
model.save('public_safety_alerts_model.h5')
```

In this example:

import numpy as np

## Generate mock image data
num_samples = 1000
img_height, img_width = 64, 64
num_classes = 10

X_train = np.random.rand(num_samples, img_height, img_width, 3)
y_train = np.random.randint(num_classes, size=num_samples)

## Define and compile the CNN model

    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(img_height, img_width, 3)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the CNN model with the mock data
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

## Save the trained CNN model
model.save('public_safety_cnn_model.h5')
```

In this example:

- The Python file `cnn_model_training.py` is located at the path `machine-learning/models/keras/public-safety-alerts/training/` within the project structure.

- The file uses TensorFlow and Keras to define, compile, train, and save a CNN model for analyzing public safety-related images using mock image data.
