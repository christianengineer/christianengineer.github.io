    <title>Using Characters and Actions in Sentences for Clear and Concise Writing</title>
</head>

    <h1 id="how-to-make-your-engineering-documents-more-clear-and-concise">How to make your engineering documents more
        clear and concise</h1>
    <p>
        The importance of clear and concise communication grows as you become more senior in your engineering career. It
        helps your readers understand your thoughts, technical solutions, and decisions quickly. These are the patterns
        I use in my daily writing to enable faster decision-making amongst other leaders and colleagues.
    </p>
    <p>Convert characters (X) to nouns and actions (Y) to verbs:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>X because Y.</li>
        <li>Since X, Y.</li>
        <li>If X, then Y.</li>
        <li>Although X, Y.</li>
        <li>X and/but/so Y.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Using these patterns will help break up your writing, engaging your readers with easier to digest sentences,
        keeping them interested in your message.</p>
    <p>They will also make your documentation easier to understand and convey meaning effectively,
        reducing confusion and misinterpretation. </p>
    <p>Your new writing style will have a greater impact on your readers, as they draw attention to specific points and
        emphasize their importance.</p>
    <h2 id="x-because-y">X because Y:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>&quot;The Next.js page used getInitialProps because it needed to fetch data before it was rendered.&quot;
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>&quot;The Next.js app used the built-in CSS-in-JS library because it needed to handle styling
                dynamically.&quot;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>&quot;The React component re-rendered because the state changed.&quot;
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="since-x-y">Since X, Y:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>&quot;Since the TypeScript code was strongly typed, the compiler caught type errors during
                development.&quot;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>&quot;Since the React component used a context hook, it shared state with other components without
                passing props.&quot;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>&quot;Since the GraphQL API used types, the data was validated before it reached the backend.&quot;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>&quot;Since Next.js used automatic code splitting, the users only downloaded the code they needed.&quot;
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="if-x-then-y">If X, then Y:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>&quot;If the React component received new props, then it re-rendered with updated data.&quot;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>&quot;If the TypeScript code had type errors, then the compiler wouldn&#39;t generate JavaScript
                code.&quot;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>&quot;If the Next.js app used client-side rendering, then the pages would update without reloading the
                page.&quot;</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="although-x-y">Although X, Y:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>&quot;Although the browser faced compatibility issues, the JavaScript code was written to support
                multiple browsers.&quot;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>&quot;Although the TypeScript code was more complex, it had better type safety and prevented runtime
                errors.&quot;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>&quot;Although the GraphQL API had strict requirements, it was easier to scale and maintain.&quot;</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="x-andbutso-y">X and/but/so Y:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>&quot;The GraphQL API used subscriptions and real-time updates, and the frontend was always up to
                date.&quot;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>&quot;The Next.js pages used the shared components, but they were also customizable for each specific
                page.&quot;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>&quot;The React component used a state hook and re-rendered when the state changed, but it also used
                React.memo to optimize for performance.&quot;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>&quot;The React component used a context hook and shared state with other components, so the data was
                consistent throughout the application.&quot;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>&quot;The TypeScript code was written with the latest syntax and features, and the compiler compiled it
                to JavaScript that was compatible with older browsers.&quot;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>&quot;The GraphQL API used types and strict validation, and the data was always consistent and
                reliable.&quot;</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>By using the patterns above, you can effectively communicate technical concepts and solutions, and
        leave a lasting impression on your readers. Rewrite your sentences to include characters as nouns and actions as
        verbs. This will improve the clarity and conciseness of all your engineering documents.</p>
