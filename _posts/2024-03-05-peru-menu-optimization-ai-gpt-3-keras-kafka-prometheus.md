# Load raw data
data = pd.read_csv('menu_data.csv')

# Data preprocessing steps
def preprocess_data(data):
    # Impute missing values with the mean
    imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
    data['menu_item_price'] = imputer.fit_transform(data['menu_item_price'].values.reshape(-1, 1))
    
    # Scale numerical features
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    data['scaled_menu_item_price'] = scaler.fit_transform(data['menu_item_price'].values.reshape(-1, 1))
    
    # Encode categorical variables
    encoded_data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['cuisine_type'])
    
    # Text feature extraction
    text_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000)  # Extract top 1000 features
    text_features = text_vectorizer.fit_transform(data['menu_item_description'])
    text_df = pd.DataFrame(text_features.toarray(), columns=text_vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
    
    # Combine numerical, categorical, and text features
    processed_data = pd.concat([encoded_data, text_df], axis=1)
    
    return processed_data

# Preprocess data
processed_data = preprocess_data(data)
