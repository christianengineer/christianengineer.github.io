    ## Instantiate and train a complex machine learning algorithm (Random Forest)
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=10, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    ## Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    ## Evaluate the model

    model = Sequential([
        Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
        Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

    ## Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='binary_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

train_complex_dl_algorithm(data_file_path, model_save_path)
```

In this example:
- The `train_complex_dl_algorithm` function takes in the file path of the mock data file and the path where the trained model will be saved.
- It loads the mock data, performs preprocessing and feature engineering (not shown in this example), splits the data into training and testing sets, builds and trains a deep learning model using Keras and TensorFlow, evaluates the model's accuracy, and saves the trained model to the specified location.
- The example usage at the bottom demonstrates how the function can be called with the file paths for the mock data and the location to save the trained model.
