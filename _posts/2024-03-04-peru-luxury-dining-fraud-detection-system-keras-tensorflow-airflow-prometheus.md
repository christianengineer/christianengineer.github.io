## Potential Data Problems and Strategic Data Cleansing Practices

## Specific Problems with the Data:

1. **Missing Values**: Incomplete or missing transaction, user, or device data can lead to biased model training and inaccurate predictions.
2. **Outliers**: Unusual transactions or behaviors may skew the model's learning process, affecting its ability to generalize well.
3. **Inconsistent Data Formats**: Data inconsistencies in timestamp formats, device IDs, or other fields can hinder data processing and modeling.
4. **Imbalanced Classes**: A skewed distribution of fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions can lead to biased model predictions.

## Strategic Data Cleansing Practices:

1. **Impute Missing Values**:

   - For missing transaction amounts, fill with the median or mean value of similar transactions.
   - Missing user locations can be imputed using geolocation services or based on the most frequent location associated with the user.

2. **Outlier Detection and Treatment**:

   - Use statistical methods like z-score or interquartile range to identify outliers in transaction amounts.
   - Consider domain knowledge to differentiate between legitimate high-value transactions and potential fraudulent activities.

3. **Standardize Data Formats**:

   - Convert all timestamps to a consistent format (e.g., UTC) for uniformity.
   - Normalize device IDs to remove any inconsistencies or special characters that can impact model training.

4. **Resampling Techniques for Imbalanced Classes**:
   - Employ techniques like oversampling (SMOTE) or undersampling to balance the proportion of fraudulent and legitimate transactions in the training data.
   - Adjust class weights in the machine learning model to give more importance to the minority class.

## Project-Specific Insights:

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Implement continuous data quality checks during the data streaming process to catch anomalies early.
- **Dynamic Feature Engineering**: Update feature engineering techniques based on evolving fraud patterns and user behaviors detected in the data.

By strategically employing these project-specific data cleansing practices, the Peru Luxury Dining Fraud Detection System can ensure that the data remains robust, reliable, and optimized for training high-performing machine learning models that accurately detect and prevent fraudulent activities in real-time.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

def clean_data(data):
    ## Drop columns not needed for modeling
    data_cleaned = data.drop(['user_id', 'device_id'], axis=1)

    ## Impute missing values in 'transaction_amount' with the median
    imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='median')
    data_cleaned['transaction_amount'] = imputer.fit_transform(data_cleaned['transaction_amount'].values.reshape(-1, 1))

    ## Standardize numerical features
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    numerical_cols = ['transaction_amount', 'age']
    data_cleaned[numerical_cols] = scaler.fit_transform(data_cleaned[numerical_cols])

    return data_cleaned

## Sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'transaction_amount': [100, 150, None, 80, 200],
    'location': ['Lima', 'Cusco', 'Arequipa', 'Trujillo', 'Lima'],
    'age': [35, 28, 45, None, 39]
})

## Clean the data
cleaned_data = clean_data(data)
print(cleaned_data)
```

This Python code snippet includes a `clean_data` function that performs data cleansing operations such as dropping unnecessary columns, imputing missing values with median, and standardizing numerical features using the `SimpleImputer` and `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn. The function takes a Pandas DataFrame as input and returns the cleaned DataFrame.

You can customize this code further based on the specific characteristics of your data and additional cleansing requirements. Remember to adapt the code to your project's data schema and cleansing needs for optimal performance.
