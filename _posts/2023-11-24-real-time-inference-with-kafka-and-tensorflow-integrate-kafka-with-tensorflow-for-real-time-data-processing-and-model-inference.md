Certainly! Below is an example of a function for a complex machine learning algorithm in Python for the Real-time Inference with Kafka and TensorFlow application. The function takes a file path as input, reads mock data from the specified file, preprocesses the data, performs model inference using TensorFlow, and returns the inference results.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

## Define a function for a complex machine learning algorithm
def perform_realtime_inference(file_path):
    ## Read mock data from the file
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        mock_data = file.read()

    ## Preprocess the data as required by the model
    preprocessed_data = preprocess_data(mock_data)

    ## Load the trained TensorFlow model
    loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('path_to_saved_model')

    ## Perform model inference
    inference_result = loaded_model.predict(preprocessed_data)

    return inference_result

## Define a data preprocessing function for the mock data
def preprocess_data(data):
    ## Mock preprocessing step (e.g., tokenization, normalization, feature engineering)
    preprocessed_data = np.random.rand(10, 5)  ## Placeholder for preprocessed data

    return preprocessed_data

## Example usage of the function with a file path
file_path = 'path_to_mock_data_file/mock_data.txt'
inference_result = perform_realtime_inference(file_path)
print("Inference Result:", inference_result)
```

In this example:
- The `perform_realtime_inference` function takes a file path as input, reads mock data from the specified file, preprocesses the data using the `preprocess_data` function, loads a trained TensorFlow model, performs inference on the preprocessed data, and returns the inference result.
- The `preprocess_data` function serves as a placeholder for data preprocessing steps, demonstrating a simple mock data preprocessing process.
- The `file_path` variable is used to specify the path to the mock data file for performing the real-time inference.

Please note that the actual implementation of the machine learning algorithm and data preprocessing logic would vary based on the specific requirements of the application and the trained models used for real-time inference.

    return preprocessed_data

file_path = 'path_to_mock_data_file/mock_data.txt'
inference_result = perform_realtime_inference_deep_learning(file_path)
