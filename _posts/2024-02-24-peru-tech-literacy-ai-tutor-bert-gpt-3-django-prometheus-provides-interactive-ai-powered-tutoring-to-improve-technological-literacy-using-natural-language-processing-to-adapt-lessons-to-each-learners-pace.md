```python
# train_model.py
import pandas as pd
from transformers import BertTokenizer, TFBertForSequenceClassification
import tensorflow as tf

# Load mock data
df = pd.read_csv("data/mock_user_data.csv")

# Tokenize user input using BERT tokenizer
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
encoded_inputs = tokenizer(df['input_text'].tolist(), padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=128, return_tensors='tf')

# Load pre-trained BERT model
model = TFBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=5e-5)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss=model.compute_loss)

# Train the BERT model
model.fit(encoded_inputs, df['label'].values, epochs=3)

# Save the trained model
model.save_pretrained("models/trained_bert_model")
```

File Path: `scripts/train_model.py`

This Python script `train_model.py` loads mock user data, tokenizes user input texts using BERT tokenizer, loads a pre-trained BERT model for sequence classification, compiles the model, trains it on the encoded inputs and corresponding labels, and finally saves the trained BERT model in the `models/trained_bert_model` directory within the Peru Tech Literacy AI Tutor project. The script leverages TensorFlow and Hugging Face's Transformers library for BERT model training with mock data.

```python
# complex_ml_algorithm.py
import pandas as pd
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel
import torch

# Load mock data
df = pd.read_csv("data/mock_lesson_data.csv")

# Initialize GPT-3 tokenizer and model
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')

# Tokenize lesson content
input_ids = tokenizer(df['lesson_text'], return_tensors='pt', padding=True, truncation=True)

# Generate responses using GPT-3
output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=200, num_return_sequences=1, temperature=0.7, num_beams=5)

# Decode and display generated responses
decoded_output = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(decoded_output)

# Save generated responses
df['generated_response'] = decoded_output
df.to_csv("data/generated_responses.csv", index=False)
```

File Path: `scripts/complex_ml_algorithm.py`

This Python script `complex_ml_algorithm.py` loads mock lesson data, initializes the GPT-3 tokenizer and model, tokenizes the lesson content, generates responses using GPT-3, decodes and displays the generated responses, and saves them in a CSV file `generated_responses.csv` in the `data/` directory within the Peru Tech Literacy AI Tutor project. The script utilizes the Hugging Face's Transformers library for GPT-3 model implementation with mock data.
