Sure, I can provide a basic example of a file for training a Scikit-Learn model using mock data. In this case, I'll create a simple Python script using Scikit-Learn's linear regression model with mock data. 

Here's a basic training file:

**File Path:** `src/model_training/train_demand_prediction_model.py`

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Mock data for training demand prediction model
X = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]).T  # Example input features
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5])     # Example target variable (demand)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
train_predictions = model.predict(X_train)
test_predictions = model.predict(X_test)
train_rmse = mean_squared_error(y_train, train_predictions, squared=False)
test_rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, test_predictions, squared=False)

# Print model evaluation metrics
print("Train RMSE:", train_rmse)
print("Test RMSE:", test_rmse)

# Save the trained model to a file
import joblib
model_file_path = 'models/scikit-learn/demand_prediction/model.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, model_file_path)
print("Trained model saved to", model_file_path)
```

In this example, the script `train_demand_prediction_model.py` trains a demand prediction model using Scikit-Learn's Linear Regression model with mock data. The trained model is then saved to a file using joblib.

This file can be used as a starting point for training a demand prediction model and can serve as a template to train more sophisticated models using real data for the Public Transportation Optimization application.

Sure, I can craft a Python script for training a complex machine learning algorithm using TensorFlow with mock data for urban transit optimization.

**File Path:** `src/model_training/train_travel_time_forecasting_model.py`

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Mock data for training travel time forecasting model
X = np.random.rand(100, 5)  # Example input features (e.g., historical travel data)
y = np.random.rand(100)     # Example target variable (e.g., travel time)

# Data preprocessing
scaler = StandardScaler()
X = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Build the TensorFlow model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), verbose=0)

# Evaluate the model
train_predictions = model.predict(X_train).flatten()
test_predictions = model.predict(X_test).flatten()
train_rmse = mean_squared_error(y_train, train_predictions, squared=False)
test_rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, test_predictions, squared=False)

# Print model evaluation metrics
print("Train RMSE:", train_rmse)
print("Test RMSE:", test_rmse)

# Save the trained model
model_dir = 'models/tensorflow/travel_time_forecasting'
model.save(model_dir)
print("Trained model saved to", model_dir)
```

In this example, we train a complex travel time forecasting model using TensorFlow's Keras API with mock data. The neural network architecture consists of multiple dense layers. The trained model is then saved to a directory using TensorFlow's model-saving functionality.

This script can be used as a foundation for training complex machine learning algorithms using real data to optimize urban transit in the Public Transportation Optimization application.
