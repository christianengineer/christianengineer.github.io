```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def complex_ml_algorithm(data_path):
    ## Load mock data
    data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

    ## Data cleaning and preprocessing steps
    ## ... (e.g., handling missing values, feature engineering, etc.)

    ## Split data into features and target variable
    X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = data['target']

    ## Split data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Initialize and train a complex machine learning algorithm (e.g., RandomForestClassifier)
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    ## Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    ## Evaluate the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    return model, accuracy

## File path for the mock data
file_path = 'data/processed/mock_data.csv'

## Execute the complex ML algorithm function
trained_model, accuracy = complex_ml_algorithm(file_path)

## Print the accuracy and model details
print(f"Accuracy of the trained model: {accuracy}")
print(trained_model)
```

In this Python function for a complex machine learning algorithm, we first load mock data from a CSV file specified by the `data_path`. We then perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and splitting into training and testing sets. After that, we initialize and train a complex machine learning algorithm (in this case, a RandomForestClassifier), make predictions using the trained model, and evaluate the model's accuracy.

The function returns the trained model and its accuracy. The file path for the mock data is specified as `data/processed/mock_data.csv`.

When the function is executed, it loads the mock data, trains the complex machine learning algorithm, evaluates its accuracy, and prints the accuracy score along with the details of the trained model.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def complex_deep_learning_algorithm(data_path):
    ## Load mock data
    data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

    ## Data cleaning and preprocessing steps
    ## ... (e.g., handling missing values, feature engineering, etc.)

    ## Split data into features and target variable
    X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = data['target']

    ## Split data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Standardize the features
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

    ## Initialize a deep learning model
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

    ## Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='binary_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    ## Evaluate the model
    y_pred_prob = model.predict(X_test)
    y_pred = (y_pred_prob > 0.5).astype(int)  ## convert probabilities to binary predictions
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    return model, accuracy

## File path for the mock data
file_path = 'data/processed/mock_data.csv'

## Execute the complex deep learning algorithm function
trained_model, accuracy = complex_deep_learning_algorithm(file_path)

## Print the accuracy and model details
print(f"Accuracy of the trained deep learning model: {accuracy}")
print(trained_model.summary())
```

In this Python function for a complex deep learning algorithm, we load mock data from a CSV file specified by the `data_path`. We then perform data cleaning, preprocessing, splitting into training and testing sets, and standardizing the features.

Subsequently, we initialize a deep learning model using TensorFlow's Keras API, compile the model, and train it on the training data. After training, we evaluate the model's accuracy on the testing data and return the trained model along with its accuracy.

The file path for the mock data is specified as `data/processed/mock_data.csv`.

When the function is executed, it loads the mock data, trains the deep learning model, evaluates its accuracy, and prints the accuracy score along with the details of the trained model.
