# AI Predictive Maintenance using LSTM (Python)

## Objectives
The objective of the AI Predictive Maintenance using LSTM (Python) is to build a machine learning model that leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast equipment failures in industrial settings. By analyzing historical sensor data, the model aims to predict when maintenance is required before a failure occurs, thereby reducing downtime and optimizing maintenance schedules. 

## System Design Strategies
1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical sensor data from equipment, including temperature, vibration, pressure, and other relevant parameters.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering to extract relevant patterns and trends.
3. **Model Development**: Utilize LSTM neural networks to build a time-series forecasting model that can predict equipment failures based on patterns in the sensor data.
4. **Model Training**: Train the LSTM model using historical data, and validate its performance using techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
5. **Deployment**: Integrate the trained LSTM model into a scalable, production-ready application that can take real-time sensor data as input and provide predictive maintenance insights.

## Chosen Libraries
1. **TensorFlow/Keras**: Utilize the TensorFlow library along with the Keras API to develop and train the LSTM model. TensorFlow provides a powerful framework for building and training deep learning models, while Keras offers a high-level interface for constructing neural networks.
2. **Pandas**: Use the Pandas library for data preprocessing, manipulation, and feature engineering. Pandas provides tools for handling time-series data and preparing it for model training.
3. **NumPy**: Leverage the NumPy library for numerical computations and array manipulations. NumPy is essential for preparing input data for the LSTM model.
4. **Scikit-learn**: Employ Scikit-learn for tasks such as data splitting, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning. The library offers useful tools for evaluating the performance of the LSTM model.
5. **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Visualize the sensor data, model performance, and equipment failure predictions using Matplotlib and Seaborn. These libraries facilitate the creation of informative charts and plots.

By integrating these libraries into the Python codebase, the AI Predictive Maintenance using LSTM system can effectively process sensor data, build a robust LSTM model, and provide actionable insights for optimizing equipment maintenance.

# Infrastructure for Predictive Maintenance using LSTM (Python)

To deploy the Predictive Maintenance using LSTM (Python) forecasting equipment failures application, a scalable and resilient infrastructure is required to support the machine learning model, handle data processing, and serve predictions to end-users. 

## Components of the Infrastructure

1. **Data Ingestion**: Use a data ingestion system to collect real-time sensor data from equipment deployed in industrial settings. This could involve leveraging technologies such as Apache Kafka, Apache NiFi, or AWS Kinesis to capture and transport the data to the processing pipeline.

2. **Data Processing**: Implement a data processing pipeline to clean, transform, and preprocess the incoming sensor data. This could involve the use of cloud-based services such as AWS Lambda and AWS Glue for serverless data processing, or Apache Spark for distributed data processing.

3. **Model Serving**: Host the trained LSTM model in a scalable and efficient manner to serve real-time predictions. This can be achieved using platforms such as TensorFlow Serving for serving TensorFlow models, or by containerizing the model using Docker and deploying it on a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes.

4. **Scalable Compute**: Utilize scalable compute resources to handle the computational workload of processing and serving predictions. This could involve leveraging cloud-based infrastructure such as AWS EC2 instances, Google Cloud Compute Engine, or Azure Virtual Machines, and implementing auto-scaling to dynamically adjust resources based on demand.

5. **Monitoring and Logging**: Set up monitoring and logging infrastructure to track the performance of the deployed model, monitor system health, and capture logs for troubleshooting and auditing purposes. Technologies like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), or cloud-based monitoring solutions can be employed for this purpose.

6. **Integration and API Gateway**: Create an API gateway to expose the model predictions as a RESTful API, allowing external systems or applications to make predictions requests. This could be achieved using platforms like AWS API Gateway, Google Cloud Endpoints, or custom-built API gateways.

7. **Security and Access Control**: Implement security measures such as encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access control, and authentication mechanisms to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data and the model endpoints.

By building and deploying the Predictive Maintenance using LSTM (Python) forecasting equipment failures application on a robust infrastructure, it becomes possible to make accurate predictions for equipment failures, reduce downtime, and optimize maintenance schedules in industrial environments.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def train_lstm_model(data_file_path):
    # Load mock data
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Data preprocessing
    # Assuming the data has columns: 'timestamp', 'sensor1', 'sensor2', 'sensor3', 'target'
    features = data[['sensor1', 'sensor2', 'sensor3']]
    target = data['target']

    # Normalize the features
    scaler = MinMaxScaler()
    features_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(features)

    # Create sequences and reshape for LSTM
    seq_length = 10
    X, y = [], []
    for i in range(len(features_scaled) - seq_length):
        X.append(features_scaled[i:i + seq_length])
        y.append(target[i + seq_length])

    X, y = np.array(X), np.array(y)
    X = X.reshape((X.shape[0], X.shape[1], features.shape[1]))

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, shuffle=False)

    # Define the LSTM model
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(LSTM(50, input_shape=(X.shape[1], X.shape[2])))
    model.add(Dense(1))
    model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')

    # Train the LSTM model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), shuffle=False)

    return model
```

This function `train_lstm_model` takes a file path to the mock data as input, preprocesses the data, defines and trains an LSTM model, and returns the trained model. The mock data used by this function should be in CSV format and include columns for timestamp, sensor readings (e.g., sensor1, sensor2, sensor3), and the target variable indicating equipment failure.

To use this function for the Predictive Maintenance using LSTM (Python) forecasting equipment failures application, ensure that mock data is available at the specified file path. When called, the function will load the data, preprocess it, train the LSTM model, and return the trained model ready for evaluation and deployment.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def train_lstm_model(data_file_path):
    # Load mock data
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Data preprocessing
    X = data[['sensor1', 'sensor2', 'sensor3']].values
    y = data['target'].values

    # Normalize the features
    scaler = MinMaxScaler()
    X = scaler.fit_transform(X)

    # Reshape input to be 3D [samples, timesteps, features]
    X = X.reshape((X.shape[0], 1, X.shape[1]))

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, shuffle=False)

    # Define the LSTM model
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(LSTM(50, input_shape=(X.shape[1], X.shape[2])))
    model.add(Dense(1))
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

    # Train the LSTM model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), shuffle=False)

    return model
```

In this function, `train_lstm_model`, the mock data is loaded from a CSV file specified by the `data_file_path`. The function performs data preprocessing, including normalization of features using MinMaxScaler. It then reshapes the input data to fit the 3D input shape required by the LSTM model. The data is split into training and testing sets, and a sequential LSTM model is defined and trained using the training data. The trained model is then returned for further evaluation and deployment.
