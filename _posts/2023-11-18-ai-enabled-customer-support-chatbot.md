Filename: `chatController.js`
File Path: `chatbot/src/api/controllers/chatController.js`

```javascript
// Import required modules and dependencies
const Chat = require('../../models/chat');
const chatService = require('../../services/chatService');
const userService = require('../../services/userService');

// Handle user's chat message
exports.sendMessage = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { userId, message } = req.body;

    // Check if user exists in the system
    const userExists = await userService.checkUserExistence(userId);
    if (!userExists) {
      return res.status(404).json({ message: 'User not found.' });
    }

    // Process message
    const chatResult = await chatService.processMessage(userId, message);

    // Create a new chat entry
    const newChat = new Chat({ userId, message });
    await newChat.save();

    // Return chat response
    return res.status(200).json({ response: chatResult.response });
  } catch (error) {
    return res.status(500).json({ message: 'Internal server error.' });
  }
};
```

The `chatController.js` file handles the core logic for processing user messages and generating chat responses. It is responsible for receiving the user's message via an API endpoint, checking the user's existence, processing the message, creating a new chat entry, and returning the chatbot's response.

The file can be found at the following path: `chatbot/src/api/controllers/chatController.js`

The core logic of the AI-Enabled Customer Support Chatbot is encapsulated within the `sendMessage` function. It takes in the user's `userId` and `message` from the request body and performs the following steps:

1. Verifies if the user exists in the system by calling the `checkUserExistence` function from the `userService` module.
2. If the user does not exist, it returns a "User not found" error response.
3. Passes the `userId` and `message` to the `processMessage` function from the `chatService` module to generate a chatbot response.
4. Saves the user's message into the database by creating a new `Chat` entry and calling the `save` method.
5. Returns a successful response with the chatbot's response message.

In case of any errors during the process, the controller returns an appropriate error response.

This file is a part of the chatbot's API controllers and is responsible for handling user interactions.

Filename: `chatService.js`
File Path: `chatbot/src/services/chatService.js`

```javascript
// Import required modules and dependencies
const NLPProcessor = require('../utils/nlpProcessor');

// Process the user's message and generate a chatbot response
exports.processMessage = async (userId, message) => {
  try {
    // Perform pre-processing and analysis on the user's message
    const processedMessage = await NLPProcessor.preprocess(message);
    const intent = await NLPProcessor.classifyIntent(processedMessage);
    const entities = await NLPProcessor.extractEntities(processedMessage);

    // Perform custom logic based on the identified intent and entities
    let response;
    if (intent === 'greeting') {
      response = "Hello! How can I assist you today?";
    } else if (intent === 'faq') {
      response = await FAQService.generateResponse(entities);
    } else {
      response = "I'm sorry, but I couldn't understand your query. Please rephrase or provide more details.";
    }

    // Return the response
    return { response };
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error('Error processing message.');
  }
};
```

The `chatService.js` file contains the secondary core logic of the AI-Enabled Customer Support Chatbot. It is responsible for processing the user's message, performing natural language processing (NLP) tasks, and generating a chatbot response based on the identified intent and entities.

The file can be found at the following path: `chatbot/src/services/chatService.js`

The unique logic within the `processMessage` function includes the following steps:

1. The function receives the `userId` and `message` parameters.
2. It passes the user's message through a preprocessing step using the `preprocess` function from the `NLPProcessor` module.
3. It then classifies the intent of the processed message by calling the `classifyIntent` function from the `NLPProcessor` module.
4. It extracts entities from the processed message using the `extractEntities` function from the `NLPProcessor` module.
5. Based on the classified intent, the function performs custom logic to generate an appropriate response. For example, if the intent is a greeting, it returns a welcome message. If the intent relates to frequently asked questions (FAQs), it calls the `generateResponse` function from the `FAQService` module to provide a specific response.
6. If the intent does not match any predefined conditions, a default "unable to understand" response is provided.
7. Finally, the function returns an object containing the chatbot's response.

Note that this file integrates with other files, such as the `NLPProcessor` module, which handles the natural language processing tasks. It also mentions the `FAQService` module, which is responsible for generating responses based on recognized entities from the user's message.

This file is a part of the chatbot's service layer and plays a crucial role in processing user messages, classifying intents, extracting entities, and generating appropriate responses.

Filename: `userService.js`
File Path: `chatbot/src/services/userService.js`

```javascript
// Import required modules and dependencies
const User = require('../models/user');

// Check if a user exists in the system
exports.checkUserExistence = async (userId) => {
  try {
    // Query the user collection by ID
    const user = await User.findById(userId);
    return user !== null;
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error('Error while checking user existence.');
  }
};
```

The `userService.js` file outlines another core logic of the AI-Enabled Customer Support Chatbot. It focuses on determining whether a user exists within the system by querying the user collection in the database.

The file can be found at the following path: `chatbot/src/services/userService.js`.

The core logic within the `checkUserExistence` function includes the following steps:

1. The function receives a `userId` parameter.
2. It performs a database query to find a user with the specified `userId` using the `User` model.
3. If a user is found (i.e., a non-null user object is returned), it indicates that the user exists within the system and returns `true`.
4. If no user is found, it indicates that the user does not exist and returns `false`.

This file has a significant role in determining the existence of a user within the system, which is essential for various aspects of the chatbot functionality, such as handling user messages, maintaining user profiles, and providing personalized responses.

The `userService.js` file is dependent on the `User` model, which represents the user entity and is imported from the `../models/user` file.

This file is a part of the chatbot's service layer and contributes to the overall system by verifying user existence and ensuring accurate user management within the application.
