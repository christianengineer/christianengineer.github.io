```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed dependencies specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 5000

# Define environment variables
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Dockerfile Configuration:
1. **Base Image:** Uses the official Python 3.8-slim image for a lightweight container setup.
2. **Working Directory:** Sets the working directory within the container to `/app`.
3. **Dependency Installation:** Installs project dependencies specified in `requirements.txt` for a consistent environment setup.
4. **Port Exposure:** Exposes port 5000 to enable communication with the application.
5. **Environment Variables:** Sets `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` to ensure Python outputs are sent straight to the terminal.
6. **Command Execution:** Defines the command to run `app.py` upon container launch for running the machine learning model.

This Dockerfile provides a streamlined and optimized container configuration tailored to the performance and scalability requirements of the Luxury Brand Affinity Analysis project. This setup ensures an efficient and reliable deployment environment for the model in a production setting.
