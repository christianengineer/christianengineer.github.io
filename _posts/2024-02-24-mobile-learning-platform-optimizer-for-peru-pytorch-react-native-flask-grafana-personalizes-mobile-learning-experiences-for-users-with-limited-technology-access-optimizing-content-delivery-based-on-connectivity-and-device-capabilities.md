## Mock user data (features)
mock_data = np.random.rand(100, 5)  ## 100 samples with 5 features
mock_labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=100)  ## Binary labels for recommendations

## Define the PyTorch model
class RecommendationModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(RecommendationModel, self).__init__()
        self.hidden = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.output = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.hidden(x))
        x = self.output(x)
        return x

## Hyperparameters

        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(64 * 6 * 6, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = torch.max_pool2d(x, 2)
        x = torch.relu(self.conv2(x))
        x = torch.max_pool2d(x, 2)
        x = x.view(-1, 64 * 6 * 6)
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
