from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def complex_ml_algorithm(data_file_path):
    ## Load mock data from the specified file path
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Preprocessing and feature engineering
    ## ... (preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, encoding, feature selection, etc.)

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X = data.drop('target_column', axis=1)
    y = data['target_column']
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Initialize and train a complex machine learning model (Random Forest as an example)
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    ## Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    ## Evaluate the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    return model, accuracy

## Example usage
data_file_path = 'path/to/mock/data.csv'
trained_model, model_accuracy = complex_ml_algorithm(data_file_path)
print(f'Trained model: {trained_model}')
print(f'Model accuracy: {model_accuracy}')
```

In the code above, the `complex_ml_algorithm` function represents a complex machine learning algorithm for the MediRobot AI for Healthcare Robotics application. This function takes a file path as input, loads mock data from the specified file path, preprocesses the data, trains a Random Forest classifier, evaluates the model, and returns the trained model and its accuracy.

The placeholder `path/to/mock/data.csv` should be replaced with the actual file path where the mock data for training the machine learning model is located. This function can be further extended with additional preprocessing steps, hyperparameter tuning, and model validation as per the specific requirements of the healthcare robotics application.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Standardize the input features
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

    ## Define a complex deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    ## Evaluate the model
    _, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)

    return model, accuracy

## Example usage
data_file_path = 'path/to/mock/data.csv'
trained_model, model_accuracy = complex_deep_learning_algorithm(data_file_path)
print(f'Trained model: {trained_model}')
print(f'Model accuracy: {model_accuracy}')
```

In the code above, the `complex_deep_learning_algorithm` function represents a complex deep learning algorithm for the MediRobot AI for Healthcare Robotics application using TensorFlow/Keras. This function takes a file path as input, loads mock data from the specified file path, preprocesses the data, defines a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras, trains the model, evaluates its performance, and returns the trained model and its accuracy.
