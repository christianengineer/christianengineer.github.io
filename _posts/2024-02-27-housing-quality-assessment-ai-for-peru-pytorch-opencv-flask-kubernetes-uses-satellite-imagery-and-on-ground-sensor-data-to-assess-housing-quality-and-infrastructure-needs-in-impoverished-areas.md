train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_data, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
val_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(val_data, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False)

## Training loop
for epoch in range(epochs):
    model.train()
    for inputs, labels in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

```

In this `model_training.py` file, we simulate the training of a CNN model using mock training and validation data for the Housing Quality Assessment AI application. The file path for the mock data is defined and loaded, and the neural network model is instantiated and trained using the provided dataset. The optimizer, criterion, and hyperparameters are set up for training, and the training loop runs for the specified number of epochs. The model's performance is evaluated on the validation set after each epoch, and the trained model weights are saved for future use. Note that the paths for the actual data files should be updated accordingly.

import torch.optim as optim
from torchvision import models
import cv2
import numpy as np
from utils import load_data, preprocess_image

## Define file paths for mock data (replace with actual file paths)

## Load and preprocess mock data
image = cv2.imread(image_path)
sensor_data = np.loadtxt(sensor_data_path, delimiter=',')

## Preprocess image and sensor data
processed_image = preprocess_image(image)

feature_extractor.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    image_tensor = torch.from_numpy(processed_image).unsqueeze(0).permute(0, 3, 1, 2).float()
    features = feature_extractor(image_tensor).squeeze().numpy()

## Combine image and sensor data features
combined_features = np.concatenate((features, normalized_sensor_data))

## Define a complex ML algorithm (e.g., ensemble model, hybrid model)
class ComplexModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size):
        super(ComplexModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, 2)  ## Two classes for housing quality assessment

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

## Initialize and train the complex ML algorithm
input_size = combined_features.shape[0]
model = ComplexModel(input_size)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

## Mock labels

outputs = model(torch.from_numpy(combined_features).float())
loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
optimizer.zero_grad()
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()

## Prediction for the sample data

```

In this `complex_ml_algorithm.py` file, a complex machine learning algorithm is implemented for the Housing Quality Assessment AI application using mock satellite imagery and on-ground sensor data. The script loads and preprocesses the image and sensor data, extracts features from the image using a pre-trained CNN model (ResNet-50), combines the image and sensor data features, and feeds them into the complex ML algorithm (in this case, a custom neural network model). The algorithm is trained on the sample data with a mock label and makes a prediction on the housing quality based on the input features. The paths for the actual data files should be updated accordingly.
