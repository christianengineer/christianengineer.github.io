```
deployment/
└── deploy.py  ## Script for deploying TensorFlow models
```

In the "deployment" directory of the Automated Drug Discovery Platform, the "deploy.py" file handles the deployment of the TensorFlow models for the pharmaceuticals application. This script may include the following functionalities:

- **Model Loading**: Loading the trained TensorFlow model along with any associated pre-processing or post-processing functions.

- **Inference**: Implementing functionality to perform inference using the deployed model on new data or input.

- **API Integration**: Creating endpoints or integrating the model with an API service to allow external systems to submit data for inference.

- **Scalability**: Ensuring that the deployment script facilitates scalable and robust deployment of the model, possibly through containerization or integration with cloud-based services.

- **Error Handling** and **Logging**: Implementing error handling routines and logging mechanisms to capture and handle potential issues during model deployment and inference.

Additionally, in a production environment, the deployment process may involve considerations related to model versioning, A/B testing, and monitoring for model performance and health.

The deployment script is a crucial component in the AI Automated Drug Discovery Platform, as it enables the operationalization of trained models for real-world usage, allowing the pharmaceuticals application to leverage the predictive capabilities of the machine learning models in a production setting.

Certainly! Below is an example of a script for training a TensorFlow model within the Automated Drug Discovery Platform. This script uses mock data for demonstration purposes.

**File Path**: `models/tensorflow/training/train.py`

```python
## models/tensorflow/training/train.py

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

## Mock data generation
np.random.seed(0)
X = np.random.rand(100, 2)
y = np.random.randint(2, size=100)

## Splitting the mock data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Define and compile a simple TensorFlow model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(2,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model using the mock data
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))

## Save the trained model
model.save('trained_model.h5')
```

In this example, the script `train.py` generates mock data, splits it into training and validation sets, defines a simple TensorFlow model, compiles the model, trains it using the mock data, and saves the trained model to a file named `trained_model.h5`.

This script demonstrates the training process for a TensorFlow model within the Automated Drug Discovery Platform, serving as a foundational component for building and evaluating more complex models using real pharmaceutical data.

Certainly! Below is an example of a script for training a more complex machine learning algorithm using TensorFlow within the Automated Drug Discovery Platform. This script uses mock data for demonstration purposes.

**File Path:** `models/tensorflow/training/train_complex_model.py`

```python
## models/tensorflow/training/train_complex_model.py

import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

## Generate mock data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, random_state=42)

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Preprocess the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_normalized = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_normalized = scaler.transform(X_test)

## Define a complex TensorFlow model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(20,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.3),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train_normalized, y_train, epochs=20, validation_data=(X_test_normalized, y_test))

## Save the trained model
model.save('trained_complex_model.h5')
```

In this script, we demonstrate the training of a more complex machine learning algorithm using TensorFlow within the Automated Drug Discovery Platform. The script generates mock data using scikit-learn's `make_classification` function, splits the data into training and testing sets, preprocesses the data using standard scaling, defines a complex neural network model using TensorFlow's Keras API, compiles the model, trains it using the mock data, and saves the trained model to a file named `trained_complex_model.h5`.

This script showcases the implementation of a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm for potential use in pharmaceutical applications within the Automated Drug Discovery Platform.
