1. Conduct pre-deployment checks to ensure model and data readiness.
2. Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI in Docker containers.
3. Monitor the model using Prometheus and Grafana for performance tracking.
4. Scale deployment with Kubernetes and automate workflows with Airflow.
5. Manage versions with Git for rollbacks and changes.
6. Integrate model predictions with the Competitive Intelligence Dashboard using REST API.

By following this deployment plan tailored to the unique demands of the Competitive Intelligence Dashboard project, Supermercados Peruanos can successfully deploy the machine learning model into production, ensuring reliability, scalability, and continuous monitoring for data-driven strategic planning in Peruâ€™s competitive retail environment.

```Dockerfile
# Use a Python base image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements.txt and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt /app/
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the model files and preprocessed data
COPY model.py /app/
COPY preprocessed_data.csv /app/

# Expose the required port
EXPOSE 5000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["python", "model.py"]
```

### Description:
- This Dockerfile creates a container for deploying the machine learning model in a production environment.
- It sets up the Python environment, installs dependencies, copies the model file, preprocessed data, and exposes the required port.

### Instructions:
1. **Optimized Performance**:
   - Minimize image size by using a slim Python base image for faster deployment and reduced resource consumption.
   - Utilize `--no-cache-dir` flag during dependency installation to speed up the process and prevent cache bloat.

2. **Scalability Requirements**:
   - Set the working directory to `/app` for a clean and organized container structure.
   - Expose port 5000 to enable communication with external services or APIs.

3. **Dependency Management**:
   - Copy `requirements.txt` and install dependencies in a separate step to leverage Docker cache for faster builds.
   - Ensure preprocessed data and model file are included in the container for seamless model execution.

4. **Execution Command**:
   - Specify the command `python model.py` to run the application when the container starts.

By using this Dockerfile optimized for performance and scalability, Supermercados Peruanos can encapsulate their machine learning model environment efficiently, ensuring optimal performance and scalability for the project's production deployment.
