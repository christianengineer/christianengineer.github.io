```python
# File: model_training.py
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import numpy as np

# Mock data for educational disparities
X = np.random.rand(100, 5)  # Features: 100 samples, 5 features
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=100)  # Binary labels: 0 or 1

# Define a simple neural network model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model on mock data
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Save the trained model
model.save('models/trained_models/mock_model')
```

### File Path: `src/model_training/model_training.py`

In this script, a simple neural network model is trained on mock data representing educational disparities. The model is compiled, trained for 10 epochs, and saved in the directory `models/trained_models/mock_model`. This file demonstrates the training process for developing machine learning models to analyze educational disparities for the Peru Educational Disparity Dashboard application.

```python
# File: complex_model_training.py
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import numpy as np

# Mock data for educational disparities (complex)
X = np.random.rand(100, 10)  # Features: 100 samples, 10 features
y = np.random.randint(0, 3, size=100)  # Multiclass labels: 0, 1, or 2

# Define a more complex neural network model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(20, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model

# Train the model on mock data
model.fit(X, y, epochs=20, batch_size=32)

# Save the trained model
model.save('models/trained_models/complex_model')
```

### File Path: `src/model_training/complex_model_training.py`

In this script, a more complex neural network model is trained on mock data representing educational disparities with multiple classes. The model architecture is deeper with additional hidden layers and a softmax output layer for multiclass classification.
