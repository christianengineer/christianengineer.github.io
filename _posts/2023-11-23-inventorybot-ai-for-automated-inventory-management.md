Sure, here's an example of a function for a complex machine learning algorithm used in the InventoryBot AI application. We'll create a function for training a demand forecasting model using mock data. The function will use the `demand_forecasting_model.py` file within the `models/demand_forecasting/` directory.

```python
# Example function for training a demand forecasting model using mock data
import pandas as pd
from models.demand_forecasting.demand_forecasting_model import DemandForecastingModel
from models.demand_forecasting.demand_forecasting_data_preparation import preprocess_demand_data

def train_demand_forecasting_model(data_file_path):
    # Load mock data
    mock_demand_data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Preprocess the data
    preprocessed_data = preprocess_demand_data(mock_demand_data)

    # Instantiate the demand forecasting model
    model = DemandForecastingModel()

    # Train the model
    model.train(preprocessed_data)

    # Save the trained model
    model.save_model("trained_demand_forecasting_model.pkl")

    return "Demand forecasting model training completed and saved."
```

In this example, we assume that the `demand_forecasting_model.py` file contains the `DemandForecastingModel` class with methods for training and saving the model. The `preprocess_demand_data` function prepares the mock demand data for training. The `train_demand_forecasting_model` function takes the file path to the mock data as input, processes the data, trains the model, and saves the trained model to a file.

Here's the file path where the function is located:
```
app/
├── machine_learning/
│   ├── demand_forecasting/
│   │   ├── demand_forecasting_model.py
│   │   └── demand_forecasting_data_preparation.py
```

Certainly! Below is an example of a function for a complex deep learning algorithm used in the InventoryBot AI application. We'll create a function for training an image recognition model using mock data. The function will use the `image_recognition_model.py` file within the `models/deep_learning/` directory.

```python
# Example function for training an image recognition deep learning model using mock data
import numpy as np
from models.deep_learning.image_recognition_model import ImageRecognitionModel
from data_processing.image_data_preparation import preprocess_image_data

def train_image_recognition_model(data_directory_path):
    # Load and preprocess mock image data
    image_data, labels = preprocess_image_data(data_directory_path)

    # Instantiate the image recognition model
    model = ImageRecognitionModel()

    # Train the model
    model.train(image_data, labels)

    # Save the trained model
    model.save_model("trained_image_recognition_model.h5")

    return "Image recognition model training completed and saved."
```

In this example, we assume that the `image_recognition_model.py` file contains the `ImageRecognitionModel` class with methods for training and saving the model. The `preprocess_image_data` function prepares the mock image data for training. The `train_image_recognition_model` function takes the directory path to the mock image data as input, processes the data, trains the deep learning model, and saves the trained model to a file.

Here's the file path where the function is located:

```
app/
├── machine_learning/
│   └── deep_learning/
│       ├── image_recognition_model.py
│       └── image_data_preparation.py
```
