Certainly! Below is a Python function representing a complex machine learning algorithm for the asset prediction model in the AssetManagerAI AI for Asset Management application. This function utilizes mock data to showcase the training process of a machine learning model. I will also include a sample file path from the AI Asset Manager repository for demonstration purposes.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

def train_asset_prediction_model(data_file_path):
    ## Load mock asset data from a CSV file
    asset_data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Preprocessing: Split the data into features and target variable
    X = asset_data.drop('asset_price', axis=1)
    y = asset_data['asset_price']

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Initialize the Random Forest Regressor model
    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    ## Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    ## Evaluate the model
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")

    ## Return the trained model
    return model
```

In this example, the `train_asset_prediction_model` function loads mock asset data from a CSV file located at `data/asset_data.csv` within the AI Asset Manager repository. It then preprocesses the data, trains a Random Forest Regressor model, evaluates its performance, and returns the trained model.

This function showcases a simplified version of the training pipeline for an asset prediction machine learning algorithm. It leverages the scikit-learn library for model training and evaluation. The actual implementation in a production environment may involve more sophisticated preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and validation.

The file path `data/asset_data.csv` is a sample path within the repository and would be based on the actual structure and location of the data file in the AI Asset Manager for Asset Management application.

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Standardize the data
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

    ## Build the deep learning model
    model = Sequential([
        Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
        Dropout(0.2),
        Dense(32, activation='relu'),
        Dropout(0.2),
        Dense(1)
    ])

    ## Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss='mean_squared_error')

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    ## Return the trained deep learning model
