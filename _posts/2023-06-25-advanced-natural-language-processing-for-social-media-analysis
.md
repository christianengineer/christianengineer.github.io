# Natural Language Processing for Social Media Analysis Repository

## Description

This repository is dedicated to the development and implementation of advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the vast amount of social media data. The primary aim is to extract insights, sentiments, and trends from the data that can benefit various business, research, and societal applications. The implementation considers the complexity and the dynamic nature of the social media content that includes not only text, but also images, videos, and links.

## Goals

1. **Content Understanding**: Extract core information from social media posts, decipher the topics being discussed and understand the context.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Understand the sentiment behind the posts. This helps in concluding whether the sentiment is positive, negative or neutral.

3. **Trend Detection**: Identify and predict the upcoming trends based on the userâ€™s behaviors and discussions.

4. **Social Network Analysis**: Understand the relationships and influence among users.

5. **User Behavior Analysis**: Understand the user's interests, opinions and how they interact with different posts.

6. **Scalable User Traffic Handling**: Design and implement efficient data processing pipelines to handle massive social media data and ensure smooth user experience even during traffic surge.

## Libraries

The following libraries will be used to achieve efficient data handling:

1. **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: An open-source Python library for NLP tasks. Includes text processing libraries for tokenization, parsing, classification, stemming, tagging and semantic reasoning.

2. **TensorFlow and Keras**: These will be used for creating different machine learning models, especially for deep learning tasks.

3. **Spacy**: For more advanced NLP tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, entity recognition and dependency parsing.

4. **Pandas**: Robust library for data manipulation and analysis. Can handle large datasets efficiently.

5. **NumPy**: Adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

6. **Scikit-learn**: Essential library for machine learning in Python. Will use it for model development, training and evaluation.

7. **Gensim**: Library for unsupervised topic modeling and natural language processing. It is useful for handling large text files.

8. **Tweepy**: Python library for accessing the Twitter API.

For efficient and scalable user traffic handling, we will employ the following:

1. **Django/Flask**: Robust frameworks used for scalable web application development in Python.

2. **Redis/Celery**: For handling asynchronous tasks and jobs, especially during high user traffic times.

3. **Elasticsearch**: For search and analytics in real-time, especially useful when dealing with large datasets.

4. **PostgreSQL**: For efficient and secure database handling.

# Natural Language Processing for Social Media Analysis: Repository File Structure

This is a comprehensive and scalable file structure for the Natural Language Processing for Social Media Analysis repository.

The basic structure will be broken down as follows:
```

|-- RootProjectDir
| |-- .gitignore # Git ignore file (files listed are omitted in commits)
| |-- README.md # An overview of the project, setup, and usage instructions
| |-- requirements.txt # Required python dependencies
|  
| |-- analytics # Contains files for analytics functions
| | |-- **init**.py
| | |-- sentiment_analysis.py
| | |-- trend_detection.py
| | |-- social_network_analysis.py
| | |-- user_behavior_analysis.py
| | |-- utils.py
|  
| |-- data # Contains data files and scripts
| | |-- **init**.py
| | |-- raw # Raw data files
| | |-- processed # Processed data files
| | |-- data_handler.py # Contains scripts for data extraction, cleaning, and preprocessing
|  
| |-- models # Where model files will be stored
| | |-- **init**.py
| | |-- nlp_model.py # Contains model training, saving, loading, and prediction functions
|  
| |-- server # Backend server files
| | |-- **init**.py
| | |-- app.py # Flask/Django application
| | |-- config.py # Configuration for the server
| | |-- routes.py # Route configurations
|  
| |-- tests # Testing files
| | |-- **init**.py
| | |-- test_analytics.py
| | |-- test_data.py
| | |-- test_models.py
| | |-- test_server.py

```

Each component is separated so that any modifications to one part will not affect others. Moreover, this structure allows for scalable addition of more scripts, models, or data sources in the future.

*Note:* Always include comments to your code in order to enhance collaboration and understandability.

class NLPAnalysis:
    def __init__(self, text):

        self.vectorized_text = vectorizer.fit_transform([self.lemmatized_text])

In this piece of code, the `NLPAnalysis` class is created, which encapsulates the workflow for Natural Language Processing (NLP). The `__init__` method initializes the object with a `text` argument and several other class variables, which include `tokenized_text`, `cleaned_text`, `lemmatized_text`, and `vectorized_text`.

The `tokenize` method uses the NLTK `word_tokenize` function to tokenize the given text.

The `remove_stopwords_punctuation` method filters out the stopwords and punctuation from the tokenized text.

The `lemmatize` method converts each word in the cleaned text to its base or root form (lemmatize).

The `vectorize` method transforms the lemmatized text into a meaningful representation of numbers (vectors) using `TfidfVectorizer`.

Finally, the `perform_nlp` method performs the complete NLP process by calling all the other methods in sequential order.

The result of the `perform_nlp` method is a numerical representation of the input text, which can then be used for further machine learning tasks such as classification, clustering, sentiment analysis, etc.

_Note: Before using this code, please ensure necessary libraries are installed and appropriate NLTK datasets are downloaded._
