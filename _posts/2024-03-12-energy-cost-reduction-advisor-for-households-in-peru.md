## Project Focus and Target Variable

### Primary Focus:
The primary focus of the project should be on analyzing household energy usage patterns to provide tailored advice on reducing energy bills through efficient practices and renewable energy sources.

### Target Variable Name:
A suitable target variable name for the model could be `Energy Cost Reduction Score`. This score would be a representation of the potential energy cost savings achievable through following the recommended advice provided by the system.

### Importance of Target Variable:
The `Energy Cost Reduction Score` is crucial for this project as it encapsulates the ultimate goal of helping households in Peru reduce their energy costs. By quantifying the potential savings into a single score, users can easily understand and compare the effectiveness of different recommendations.

### Example Values:
- If a household receives an `Energy Cost Reduction Score` of 80%, it indicates that the recommended actions have the potential to reduce their energy costs by 80%.
- Alternatively, a score of 20% would suggest there is limited room for improvement in energy cost reduction through the current recommendations.

### User Decision-making:
Based on the `Energy Cost Reduction Score`, users can prioritize which recommendations to implement. For example, a household with a low score may focus on adopting more energy-efficient appliances, while a high-scoring household may consider investing in solar panels for significant cost savings in the long term. This score serves as a practical metric for users to take actionable steps towards reducing their energy bills effectively.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# Create a mock dataset with fictitious data
data = {
    'Household Size': [2, 4, 3, 5, 2],
    'Average Monthly Energy Usage (kWh)': [300, 500, 400, 600, 350],
    'Energy-Saving Actions Taken (count)': [2, 3, 1, 4, 2],
    'Renewable Energy Sources Used (binary)': [0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    'Energy Cost Reduction Score (%)': [75, 85, 65, 90, 70]
}

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Define the features (X) and the target variable (y)
X = df.drop('Energy Cost Reduction Score (%)', axis=1)
y = df['Energy Cost Reduction Score (%)']

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the Random Forest Regressor model
model = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

```

This Python script generates a mock dataset with fictitious data representing household features and the corresponding `Energy Cost Reduction Score`, creates and trains a Random Forest Regressor model, predicts the target variable for the test set, and evaluates the model's performance using Mean Absolute Error. By defining clear features and a target variable based on the project's objective, this script provides a structured approach to building and assessing the model for predicting energy cost reduction scores.

## Secondary Target Variable: Energy Efficiency Improvement Potential Score

### Importance of Secondary Target Variable:
The `Energy Efficiency Improvement Potential Score` could play a crucial role in enhancing the predictive model's accuracy and providing valuable insights. This score would quantify the potential for improving energy efficiency within a household, considering factors such as appliance usage, insulation quality, and heating/cooling systems. By incorporating this secondary target variable, the model can offer more tailored and impactful recommendations to users, ultimately leading to significant energy cost reductions and environmental benefits.

### Complementarity with Primary Target Variable:
The `Energy Efficiency Improvement Potential Score` complements the `Energy Cost Reduction Score` by providing a deeper understanding of where and how energy efficiency improvements can be made within a household. While the `Energy Cost Reduction Score` focuses on the overall potential savings, the `Energy Efficiency Improvement Potential Score` delves into specific areas for optimization, guiding users towards targeted actions that can maximize energy savings and sustainability efforts.

### Example Values:
- A household with a high `Energy Efficiency Improvement Potential Score` of 90% may benefit from upgrading to energy-efficient appliances, improving insulation, and optimizing heating/cooling settings for significant long-term energy savings.
- In contrast, a low score of 30% could indicate that the household has already implemented many energy-saving practices, prompting a focus on more advanced solutions like solar panel installation or smart energy management systems.

### User Decision-making:
Users can leverage the `Energy Efficiency Improvement Potential Score` to prioritize energy efficiency upgrades based on specific recommendations tailored to their household profile. For instance, a user with a high score in heating/cooling systems optimization could prioritize insulating their home or upgrading to a smart thermostat. By guiding users towards areas with the highest potential for improvement, this score empowers them to make informed decisions that align with their energy efficiency goals and contribute to groundbreaking results in sustainable energy practices.

```

This Python script generates a mock dataset with fictitious data representing household features, `Energy Cost Reduction Score`, and `Energy Efficiency Improvement Potential Score`. It then creates and trains two separate Random Forest Regressor models for each target variable, predicts the target variable values for the test set, and evaluates the models' performance using Mean Absolute Error. This approach allows for the simultaneous assessment of energy cost reduction potential and energy efficiency improvement possibilities, providing users with comprehensive insights to optimize their energy usage and reduce costs effectively.

## Third Target Variable: Carbon Footprint Reduction Potential Score

### Importance of Third Target Variable:
The `Carbon Footprint Reduction Potential Score` could be instrumental in enhancing the predictive model's accuracy and providing holistic insights into household energy practices. This score would quantify the potential for reducing the carbon footprint associated with energy consumption, taking into account energy sources, usage patterns, and efficiency improvements. By incorporating this target variable, the model can offer environmentally conscious recommendations to users, aligning energy cost reduction efforts with sustainable practices.

### Complementarity with Primary and Secondary Target Variables:
The `Carbon Footprint Reduction Potential Score` complements the `Energy Cost Reduction Score` and `Energy Efficiency Improvement Potential Score` by addressing the environmental impact of energy consumption. While the primary target focuses on cost savings and the secondary target emphasizes efficiency improvements, the third target variable shifts the focus to carbon emission reductions. By considering all three scores together, users can make informed decisions that not only lower their energy bills but also contribute significantly to environmental sustainability.

### Example Values:
- A household with a high `Carbon Footprint Reduction Potential Score` of 90% may benefit from transitioning to renewable energy sources, optimizing energy usage during peak hours, and reducing overall energy consumption for substantial carbon footprint reductions.
- Conversely, a low score of 30% could indicate opportunities for implementing energy-efficient practices and adopting greener technologies to minimize carbon emissions associated with household energy usage.

### User Decision-making:
Users can leverage the `Carbon Footprint Reduction Potential Score` to prioritize actions that align with their sustainability goals. For instance, a high score in renewable energy adoption may prompt a household to invest in solar panels or switch to a green energy provider. By quantifying the environmental impact of energy-saving measures, this score empowers users to make eco-conscious choices and drive groundbreaking results in reducing carbon footprints while simultaneously optimizing energy costs and efficiency.
