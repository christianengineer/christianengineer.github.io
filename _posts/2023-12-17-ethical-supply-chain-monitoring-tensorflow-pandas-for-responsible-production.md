    - `setup_server.sh`: A shell script that automates the setup of the server environment, including installing necessary dependencies and configuring the serving infrastructure.
    - `start_model_serving.sh`: A shell script for starting the model serving process, setting up API endpoints, and initializing monitoring and logging for the deployed models. Additional scripts may be included for monitoring, scaling, and managing the model serving infrastructure.

These deployment-specific files and scripts provide the necessary infrastructure and automation to effectively deploy the machine learning models for the responsible production application leveraging TensorFlow and Pandas for ethical supply chain monitoring.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a machine learning model for the Ethical Supply Chain Monitoring application using mock data. This mock data is assumed to be stored in a CSV file named `mock_supply_chain_data.csv` within the `data/` directory of the project.

```python
## File Path: src/model_training/train_model.py

import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

## Load mock supply chain data
data_path = '../data/mock_supply_chain_data.csv'
supply_chain_data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

## Preprocess the data
## ... (Data preprocessing steps using Pandas)

## Define features and target variable
X = supply_chain_data.drop(columns=['target_column'])
y = supply_chain_data['target_column']

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Feature scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

## Define and train a TensorFlow model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test_scaled, y_test))

## Evaluate the trained model
y_pred = model.predict_classes(X_test_scaled)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}')
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

In this script, the mock supply chain data is loaded from the `mock_supply_chain_data.csv` file within the `data/` directory. The data is then preprocessed using Pandas, and a TensorFlow model is defined and trained. Finally, the model is evaluated using the testing data.

This script serves as an example of how a machine learning model can be trained using mock data for the Ethical Supply Chain Monitoring application, leveraging Pandas for data preprocessing and TensorFlow for model training.

The file path for this script is `src/model_training/train_model.py` within the project structure.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script defining a complex machine learning algorithm for the Ethical Supply Chain Monitoring application using mock data, alongside relevant module imports, and appropriate file paths. This script, `complex_model_algorithm.py`, resides within the `src/model_training/` directory of the project structure.

```python
## File Path: src/model_training/complex_model_algorithm.py

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import tensorflow as tf

## Load mock supply chain data
data_path = '../data/mock_supply_chain_data.csv'
supply_chain_data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

## Preprocess the data using Pandas
## ... (Data preprocessing steps)

## Define features and target variable
X = supply_chain_data.drop(columns=['target_column'])
y = supply_chain_data['target_column']

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Example of complex machine learning algorithm
## Feature scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

## Random Forest Classifier
random_forest_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=3, random_state=42)
random_forest_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

## Neural Network Model using TensorFlow
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test_scaled, y_test))

## Evaluating both models
y_pred_rf = random_forest_model.predict(X_test_scaled)
print("Random Forest Classifier:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_rf))

y_pred_nn = model.predict_classes(X_test_scaled)
print("Neural Network Model:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_nn))
```

In this script, mock supply chain data is loaded using Pandas, preprocessed, and utilized to train two different models: a Random Forest Classifier and a Neural Network Model using TensorFlow. The script demonstrates a complex algorithmic approach utilizing two distinct machine learning models for the ethical supply chain monitoring application.

The script file path is `src/model_training/complex_model_algorithm.py` within the project directory structure.
