In the `machine_learning/models/` directory, the following structure and files are included:

- `trained_models/`: Directory for storing trained machine learning models. Each trained model is organized within its own subdirectory (e.g., `model1/`, `model2/`). Within each model subdirectory:

  - `model.pb`: The serialized model file containing the model architecture and trained weights.
  - `variables/`: Directory for storing model variables and other supplementary files.

- `model_training/`: Directory containing scripts for training machine learning models (e.g., `train_model1.py`, `train_model2.py`).

- `model_evaluation/`: Directory containing scripts for evaluating machine learning models on test datasets (e.g., `evaluate_model1.py`, `evaluate_model2.py`).

This structure organizes the machine learning-related files into separate directories, facilitating the management of trained models, training scripts, and evaluation scripts in the Large Scale IoT Data Analytics application.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a TensorFlow model using mock data for the Large Scale IoT Data Analytics application. Let's call the file `train_model.py`, and it can be located within the `machine_learning/model_training/` directory of the repository:

```python
## machine_learning/model_training/train_model.py

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

## Generate mock IoT data for training
num_samples = 1000
num_features = 10
X_train = np.random.rand(num_samples, num_features)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=num_samples)  ## Binary classification labels

## Define a simple TensorFlow model for training
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(num_features,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

## Save the trained model
model.save('trained_models/mock_iot_model')
```

In this example, the script generates mock IoT data for training using NumPy, defines a simple TensorFlow model using the Keras API, trains the model on the generated data, and then saves the trained model to the `trained_models/` directory within the repository.

The file `train_model.py` would be located at the following path within the repository:
`Large-Scale-IoT-Data-Analytics/machine_learning/model_training/train_model.py`

Certainly! Below is an example of a more complex machine learning algorithm using TensorFlow to train a neural network with mock IoT data for the Large Scale IoT Data Analytics application. Let's call the file `complex_model_training.py`, and it can be located within the `machine_learning/model_training/` directory of the repository:

```python
## Large-Scale-IoT-Data-Analytics/machine_learning/model_training/complex_model_training.py

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

## Generating mock IoT data for training
num_samples = 1000
num_features = 20
X_train = np.random.rand(num_samples, num_features)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=num_samples)  ## Binary classification labels

## Define a complex neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(num_features,)),
    layers.Dropout(0.3),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.2),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=64)

## Save the trained model
model.save('trained_models/complex_iot_model')
```

In this example, the script generates mock IoT data for training, defines a more complex neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras, trains the model on the generated data, and then saves the trained model to the `trained_models/` directory within the repository.

The file `complex_model_training.py` is located at the following path within the repository:
`Large-Scale-IoT-Data-Analytics/machine_learning/model_training/complex_model_training.py`
