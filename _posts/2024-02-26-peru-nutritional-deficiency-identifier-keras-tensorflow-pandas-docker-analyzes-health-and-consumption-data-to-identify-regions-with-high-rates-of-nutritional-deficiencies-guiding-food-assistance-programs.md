To train a model for the Peru Nutritional Deficiency Identifier application using mock data, you can create a Python script named `train_model.py`. This script will demonstrate the training process using Keras, TensorFlow, and Pandas with mock data generated within the script. Below is an example of the `train_model.py` file:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

## Mock data generation
data = {
    'height': np.random.randint(140, 200, 1000),
    'weight': np.random.randint(40, 120, 1000),
    'calorie_intake': np.random.randint(1000, 4000, 1000),
    'nutrient_intake': np.random.randint(50, 200, 1000),
    'nutritional_deficiency': np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)  ## Binary label for nutritional deficiency
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

## Split data into features and target
X = df[['height', 'weight', 'calorie_intake', 'nutrient_intake']]
y = df['nutritional_deficiency']

## Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Define and train the model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=[4]),
    keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

## Save the trained model
model.save('models/trained_model.h5')
```

In the script:
- Mock data for features related to health, consumption, and nutritional deficiency is generated.
- The data is split into features (`X`) and the target variable (`y`).
- A simple neural network model is defined and trained on the mock data.
- The trained model is saved in the `models/` directory as `trained_model.h5`.

You can save this script as `train_model.py` in the root directory of your project:

```
peru-nutritional-deficiency-identifier/
    |- models/
    |- data/
    |- train_model.py
    |- ...
```

After running `train_model.py`, a trained Keras model named `trained_model.h5` will be saved in the `models/` directory of your project. This model can be used for inference in the Peru Nutritional Deficiency Identifier application.

To create a file for a more complex machine learning algorithm for the Peru Nutritional Deficiency Identifier application using mock data, you can use a script named `complex_model.py`. This script will showcase a more sophisticated model architecture for the task of identifying regions with high rates of nutritional deficiencies. Below is an example of the `complex_model.py` file:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

## Mock data generation
data = {
    'age': np.random.randint(18, 75, 1000),
    'income': np.random.randint(10000, 100000, 1000),
    'BMI': np.random.uniform(18.5, 40, 1000),
    'exercise_hours': np.random.randint(0, 10, 1000),
    'nutritional_deficiency': np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)  ## Binary label for nutritional deficiency
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

## Split data into features and target
X = df[['age', 'income', 'BMI', 'exercise_hours']]
y = df['nutritional_deficiency']

## Normalize the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

## Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Define a more complex neural network model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=[4]),
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=64, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

## Save the trained model
model.save('models/complex_trained_model.h5')
```

In the script:
- More complex mock data features related to age, income, BMI, and exercise habits are generated.
- The features are normalized using `StandardScaler` and split into training and testing sets.
- A more complex neural network model architecture is defined and trained on the normalized mock data.
- The trained model is saved in the `models/` directory as `complex_trained_model.h5`.

You can save this script as `complex_model.py` in the root directory of your project:

```
peru-nutritional-deficiency-identifier/
    |- models/
    |- data/
    |- complex_model.py
    |- ...
```

After running `complex_model.py`, a more complex trained Keras model named `complex_trained_model.h5` will be saved in the `models/` directory of your project. This model can be used for inference in the Peru Nutritional Deficiency Identifier application.
