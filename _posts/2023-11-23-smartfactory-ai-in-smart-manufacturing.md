from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

def predictive_maintenance_algorithm(data_file_path):
    ## Load mock sensor data from CSV file
    sensor_data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Preprocessing: Split features and target, scale features
    X = sensor_data.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
    y = sensor_data['target_variable']
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

    ## Train a machine learning model
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    ## Make predictions

    model.add(Dense(128, input_dim=X_train.shape[1], activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dropout(0.2))
    model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

    ## Compile the model
    optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
    model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=optimizer, metrics=['accuracy'])

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
```

In this function:

- The `quality_control_deep_learning_algorithm` function takes the file path to the mock sensor data as input.
