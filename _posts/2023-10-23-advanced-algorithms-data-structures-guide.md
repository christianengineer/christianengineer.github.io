# Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures

Algorithms and data structures form the basic building blocks of any software or program. They're essential to understanding how a program works and to increasing its efficiency. The first part of writing any program is understanding algorithms, which describe the steps a program should take, and data structures, which gather and store the data the algorithm will manipulate.

## Data Structures

Data structures allow programmers to gather and organize data in a meaningful way that is efficient and effective for computation. Data structures include:

- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Graph
- Tree
- Heap
- Hash Tables

These lower level data structures form the foundations for more advanced data structures, which include binary search trees, AVL trees, and B-trees.

### Binary Search Trees

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree data structure in which each node has only two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. For each node, all elements in the left subtree are less than the node, and all elements in the right subtree are more than the node.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.value = val
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

class BST:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None
```

### AVL Trees

An AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) tree is a type of binary search tree that is self-balancing. In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. If things become unbalanced, a rotation is performed to rebalance the tree.

### B-Trees

B-trees are another variant of the binary search tree. B-trees are 'balanced' search trees that are optimal for systems with large amounts of data and are frequently used in databases and file systems.

```python
class BTreeNode:
    def __init__(self, leaf = False):
        self.leaf = leaf
        self.keys = []
        self.child = []
```

## Advanced Algorithms

An algorithm refers to the sequence of steps a program follows to complete a specific task. Some of the main categories of algorithms include:

- Sorting Algorithms: E.g., Merge sort, Quick sort
- Search Algorithms: E.g., Binary search, Depth and Breadth-first search
- Graph Algorithms: E.g., Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths
- Dynamic Programming Algorithms: E.g., Knapsack problem, Traveling Salesman Problem

### Sorting Algorithms

**Merge sort**: Merge sort is a 'divide and conquer' algorithm. It works by dividing an unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted), and repeatedly merging sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining.

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = arr[:mid]
    right = arr[mid:]

    left = merge_sort(left)
    right = merge_sort(right)

    return merge(left, right)
```

**Quick sort**: Quick sort is also a 'divide and conquer' type sorting algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.

### Graph Algorithms

**Dijkstra's algorithm**: It is a method for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.

```python
def dijsktra(graph,start_vertex):
  D = {v:float('inf') for v in graph}
  D[start_vertex] = 0

  unvisited = list(graph)

  while len(unvisited):
    current_vertex = unvisited[0]
    for vertex in unvisited[1:]:
      if D[vertex] < D[current_vertex]:
        current_vertex = vertex

    unvisited.remove(current_vertex)
    for neighbour, distance in graph[current_vertex].items():
      if distance + D[current_vertex] < D[neighbour]:
        D[neighbour] = distance + D[current_vertex]

  return D
```

### Dynamic Programming Algorithms

**Knapsack problem**: Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.

**Traveling Salesman Problem**: Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?

The understanding and application of advanced algorithms and data structures are vital for software engineers and computer programmers. They help improve the efficiency and performance of the software, thus providing an overall effective solution.
