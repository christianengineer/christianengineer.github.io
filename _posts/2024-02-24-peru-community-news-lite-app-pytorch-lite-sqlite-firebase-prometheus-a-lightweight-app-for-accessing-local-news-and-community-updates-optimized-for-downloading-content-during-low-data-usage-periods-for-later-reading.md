## Training Script for Content Optimizer Model

## File Path: `ml_ops/model_training.py`

```python
## ml_ops/model_training.py

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from content_dataset import ContentDataset  ## Assume the dataset loading logic is implemented in content_dataset.py

## Load mock data for training
mock_data_path = "data/mock_data.csv"
dataset = ContentDataset(mock_data_path)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

## Define the PyTorch Lite model architecture
class ContentOptimizerModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ContentOptimizerModel, self).__init__()
        ## Define model layers and operations

    def forward(self, x):
        ## Define forward pass operation
        return x

## Initialize the model
model = ContentOptimizerModel()

## Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

## Train the model
num_epochs = 10
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for inputs, targets in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

## Save the trained model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "backend/models/content_optimizer_model.pt")
```

In this training script `model_training.py`, we load mock data for training the content optimizer model using PyTorch Lite. Training is performed on the defined dataset using a simple neural network architecture. The trained model is saved in the `backend/models/content_optimizer_model.pt` file for later use in the Peru Community News Lite App.

## Complex Machine Learning Algorithm Implementation

## File Path: `app/models/advanced_content_optimizer_model.py`

```python
## app/models/advanced_content_optimizer_model.py

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from content_dataset import ContentDataset  ## Assume the dataset loading logic is implemented in content_dataset.py

## Load mock data for training
mock_data_path = "data/mock_data.csv"
dataset = ContentDataset(mock_data_path)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)

## Define the advanced PyTorch Lite model architecture
class AdvancedContentOptimizerModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(AdvancedContentOptimizerModel, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(num_embeddings=1000, embedding_dim=50)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size=50, hidden_size=128, num_layers=3, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(128, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        embedded = self.embedding(x)
        lstm_out, _ = self.lstm(embedded)
        output = self.fc(lstm_out[:, -1, :])
        return output

## Initialize the advanced model
model = AdvancedContentOptimizerModel()

## Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

## Train the advanced model
num_epochs = 15
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for inputs, targets in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

## Save the trained advanced model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "backend/models/advanced_content_optimizer_model.pt")
```

In the `advanced_content_optimizer_model.py` file, we implement a complex machine learning algorithm using PyTorch Lite with a more advanced architecture, including an embedding layer, LSTM layers, and a fully connected layer. This model is trained on mock data for content optimization in the Peru Community News Lite App. The trained model is saved in the `backend/models/advanced_content_optimizer_model.pt` file for future use.
