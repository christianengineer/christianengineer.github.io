By following this deployment plan and utilizing the recommended tools and platforms tailored to your project's requirements, you can effectively deploy the machine learning model for disease outbreak prediction into a production environment with confidence and efficiency.

Below is a Dockerfile tailored to encapsulate the environment and dependencies required for deploying the machine learning model for disease outbreak prediction in a production setting. This Dockerfile includes configurations optimized for performance and scalability specific to the project's requirements:

```Dockerfile
## Use a base image with Python and required libraries
FROM python:3.9-slim

## Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

## Copy the model file and dependencies to the working directory
COPY requirements.txt /app
COPY trained_lstm_model.h5 /app/trained_lstm_model.h5

## Install necessary dependencies
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt

## Copy the model deployment script into the container
COPY model_deployment.py /app

## Expose the API port
EXPOSE 5000

## Set environment variables
ENV FLASK_APP=model_deployment.py

## Command to execute when the Docker container starts
CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
```

### Instructions:
1. **Base Image**: Utilizes a slim Python 3.9 base image for efficiency.
2. **Working Directory**: Sets the working directory in the container to `/app`.
3. **Dependencies**: Installs required libraries specified in `requirements.txt`.
4. **Model File**: Copies the pre-trained LSTM model (`trained_lstm_model.h5`) into the container.
5. **Model Deployment Script**: Adds the model deployment script (`model_deployment.py`) to the container.
6. **Port Exposition**: Exposes port 5000 for API interaction.
7. **Environment Variables**: Sets the Flask application (`model_deployment.py`) as the entry point.
8. **Command**: Specifies the command to run the Flask application upon container startup.

This Dockerfile encapsulates the necessary environment, dependencies, and model components for deploying the machine learning model in a production-ready container. It is optimized for the project's performance needs, ensuring optimal scalability and efficiency for serving disease outbreak predictions through the API.
