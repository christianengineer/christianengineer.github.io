Sure, here's an example of a function for a complex machine learning algorithm in the CrisisAvert AI for Crisis Management application. This function uses the scikit-learn library to train a random forest classifier on mock data and save the trained model to a file. The file path for saving the trained model is also included.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from joblib import dump

def train_and_save_model(data, labels, model_file_path):
    """
    Train a random forest classifier on the given data and labels, and save the trained model to a file.

    Args:
    - data (numpy.ndarray): The input data for training the model
    - labels (numpy.ndarray): The corresponding labels for the input data
    - model_file_path (str): The file path to save the trained model

    Returns:
    - None
    """

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize the random forest classifier
    clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

    # Train the classifier on the training data
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Evaluate the classifier on the testing data
    accuracy = clf.score(X_test, y_test)
    print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy}")

    # Save the trained model to a file
    dump(clf, model_file_path)
    print(f"Trained model saved to: {model_file_path}")
```

In this function, the `train_and_save_model` function takes the input data, corresponding labels, and a file path for saving the trained model. It then splits the data into training and testing sets, initializes a random forest classifier, trains the classifier on the training data, evaluates its accuracy on the testing data, and finally saves the trained model to the specified file path using scikit-learn's `RandomForestClassifier` and joblib's `dump` function.

You can call this function with mock data and a file path for saving the trained model, for example:
```python
# Mock data
data = np.random.rand(100, 10)  # Replace with your actual data
labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)  # Replace with your actual labels

# File path for saving the trained model
model_file_path = "models/trained_model.joblib"

# Call the function
train_and_save_model(data, labels, model_file_path)
```

Replace the mock data and file path with your actual data and desired file path for saving the trained model. This function demonstrates a basic workflow for training and saving a machine learning model using scikit-learn in the CrisisAvert AI for Crisis Management application.

Certainly! Here's an example of a function for a complex deep learning algorithm in the CrisisAvert AI for Crisis Management application. This function uses TensorFlow to define and train a deep learning model on mock data, and then saves the trained model to a file. The file path for saving the trained model is also included.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.losses import SparseCategoricalCrossentropy
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

def train_and_save_deep_learning_model(data, labels, model_file_path):
    """
    Define and train a deep learning model on the given data and labels using TensorFlow, and save the trained model to a file.

    Args:
    - data (numpy.ndarray): The input data for training the model
    - labels (numpy.ndarray): The corresponding labels for the input data
    - model_file_path (str): The file path to save the trained model

    Returns:
    - None
    """

    # Define the deep learning model
    model = Sequential([
        Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(data.shape[1],)),
        Dropout(0.5),
        Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        Dropout(0.5),
        Dense(3)  # Replace 3 with the number of output classes
    ])

    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
                  loss=SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
                  metrics=['accuracy'])

    # Train the model on the data and labels
    model.fit(data, labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

    # Evaluate the model
    loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(data, labels, batch_size=32)
    print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy}")

    # Save the trained model to a file
    model.save(model_file_path)
    print(f"Trained model saved to: {model_file_path}")
```

In this function, the `train_and_save_deep_learning_model` function takes the input data, corresponding labels, and a file path for saving the trained model. It then defines a simple deep learning model using TensorFlow's Keras API with fully connected layers and dropout, compiles the model with an optimizer and loss function, trains the model on the data and labels, evaluates its accuracy, and finally saves the trained model to the specified file path using TensorFlow's `model.save` method.

You can call this function with mock data and a file path for saving the trained model, for example:
```python
# Mock data
data = ...  # Replace with your actual data
labels = ...  # Replace with your actual labels

# File path for saving the trained model
model_file_path = "models/trained_deep_learning_model.h5"

# Call the function
train_and_save_deep_learning_model(data, labels, model_file_path)
```

Replace the mock data and file path with your actual data and desired file path for saving the trained model. This function demonstrates a basic workflow for defining, training, and saving a deep learning model using TensorFlow in the CrisisAvert AI for Crisis Management application.
