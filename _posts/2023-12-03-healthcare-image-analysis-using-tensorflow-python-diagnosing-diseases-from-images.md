```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def complex_machine_learning_algorithm(image_data_path):
    # Mock data for image processing
    mock_image_data = np.random.rand(224, 224, 3)  # Mock image data of shape (224, 224, 3)

    # Load the trained TensorFlow model
    model = tf.keras.models.load_model('path_to_trained_model_directory')  # Replace 'path_to_trained_model_directory' with the actual path

    # Preprocess the image data (replace with actual preprocessing steps if applicable)
    preprocessed_data = mock_image_data  # Placeholder for preprocessing steps

    # Perform prediction using the loaded model
    prediction = model.predict(np.expand_dims(preprocessed_data, axis=0))

    return prediction
```

In the `complex_machine_learning_algorithm` function, we define a simple workflow for using mock image data to perform inference using a trained TensorFlow model. The function loads a trained TensorFlow model from the specified directory and preprocesses the mock image data before making a prediction. The placeholder variables and methods can be replaced with actual logic for preprocessing and model prediction based on the requirements of the healthcare image analysis application.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def complex_machine_learning_algorithm(image_data_path):
    # Load the trained TensorFlow model
    model = tf.keras.models.load_model('path_to_trained_model_directory')  # Replace 'path_to_trained_model_directory' with the actual path

    # Mock data for image processing
    mock_image_data = np.random.rand(1, 224, 224, 3)  # Mock image data with batch dimension for model prediction

    # Preprocess the image data (replace with actual preprocessing steps if applicable)
    preprocessed_data = mock_image_data  # Placeholder for preprocessing steps

    # Perform prediction using the loaded model
    prediction = model.predict(preprocessed_data)

    return prediction
```

In the `complex_machine_learning_algorithm` function, we define a workflow for using mock image data to perform inference using a trained TensorFlow model. The function loads a trained TensorFlow model from the specified directory, preprocesses the mock image data, and then makes a prediction using the loaded model.
