# Cloud Computing Platforms: AWS, Azure, GCP

Cloud Computing Platforms have revolutionized the world of IT, bringing a multitude of benefits for large enterprises, SMEs, and even individual developers. They have transformed the way we develop, deploy, and scale software, hardware, and networking infrastructure. Top-tier vendors in this field are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This article will take a thorough look into these platforms, their services, strengths, and differences.

## Amazon Web Services (AWS)

AWS, launched in 2006, is the pioneer and leader in the cloud services industry, having the most mature range of services and steady year-on-year growth. Amazon offers over 200 fully-featured services from data centres globally, which large-scale companies such as Netflix, Unilever, and Kellogg's use.

1. **Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2):** Provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS Cloud, reducing the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, thus rapidly scaling capacity, both up and down.

2. **Simple Storage Service (S3):** An object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

3. **Relational Database Service (RDS):** Facilitates easier setup, operational tasks, and scaling of relational databases.

```python
# python example to launch an EC2 instance in AWS
import boto3
ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')

ec2.create_instances(
 ImageId='ami-0abcdef1234567890',
 MinCount=1,
 MaxCount=1,
 InstanceType='t2.micro')
```

## Microsoft Azure

Microsoft Azure, launched in 2010, is the closest competitor to AWS. Azure gives a consistent platform which facilities seamless migration and easy multilevel management. Azure is typically preferred by companies that use Windows-based software, having a stronger association with Windows Server, Dynamics, SQL Server, and Active Directory.

1. **Azure Virtual Machines:** Allows the creation of Linux and Windows virtual machines in seconds.
   
2. **SQL Database:** Relational database service based on the latest stable version of Microsoft SQL Server Database Engine.

3. **Blob Storage:** For storing large amounts of unstructured object data, such as text or binary.
   
```csharp
// C# example to create a blob in Azure
BlobServiceClient blobServiceClient = new BlobServiceClient(connectionString);
BlobContainerClient containerClient = blobServiceClient.GetBlobContainerClient("yourcontainername");
BlobClient blobClient = containerClient.GetBlobClient("yourblobname");
using var uploadFileStream = File.OpenRead(localFilePath);
await blobClient.UploadAsync(uploadFileStream, true);
uploadFileStream.Close();
```

## Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Being a late entrant, GCP, launched publically in 2013, rapidly captured the interest of companies and developers. With its solid infrastructure, data analysis, and machine learning capabilities, many businesses have fulfilled their unique requirements.

1. **Google Compute Engine (GCE):** Provides users with Virtual Machines that run in Google's innovative data centres and worldwide network.
  
2. **Google Cloud Storage (GCS):** An object storage service for any amount of data at any time.

3. **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):** A managed environment for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications.

```golang
// Go example to create a storage bucket in GCP
ctx := context.Background()
client, err := storage.NewClient(ctx)
bucket := client.Bucket(bucketName)

ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, time.Second*10)
defer cancel()
if err := bucket.Create(ctx, projectID, &storage.BucketAttrs{
	StorageClass: "COLDLINE",
	Location:     "asia",
}); err != nil {
	// TODO: handle error.
}
```

## Conclusion

Choosing the right cloud platform may depend on various factors like budget, specific needs, business requirements, and functional services. AWS stands strong with its comprehensive offerings and mature services. Azure works best for organizations invested heavily in Microsoft technologies. Lastly, GCP is highly recommended for projects focused on analytics, big data applications, and machine learning. Irrespective of the provider, Cloud computing undeniably provides agility, scalability, and efficiency in running IT infrastructure.
