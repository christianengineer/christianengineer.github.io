```

### Notes:

- **services:** Each subdirectory under `services` contains the source code for a specific microservice. The `deploy` directory could have separate subdirectories for different deployment environments like `development`, `staging`, and `production`.
  
- **lib:** The `lib` directory houses shared code, such as utility functions and common libraries, that can be used by any of the services to avoid code duplication.

- **frontend:** Contains the source code for the Customer Portal's frontend. It's structured in a typical manner for modern JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js.

- **docs:** All documentation, such as API specifications, architecture diagrams, and design documents, will be stored here. This should be updated regularly as the project evolves.

- **scripts:** You can include scripts required for database migrations, data seeding, or other utilities.

- **tests:** High-level tests that are not specific to any single microservice should be placed here. This may include end-to-end tests, performance tests, and integration tests.

- **Configuration Management:** Sensitive environment-specific variables should not be stored in the version control system. Instead, use secret management systems provided by the cloud service provider or third-party tools like HashiCorp Vault.

- **CI/CD:** Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment configuration files can be placed in a root directory like `/.ci` or within the `/deploy` directory depending on the CI/CD tools used.

It's important to keep in mind that this file structure should be adapted based on the specific needs of the project and the evolution of technology stacks involved. As the project grows and additional services are added, the structure may need to evolve, adhering to the principles of scalability and maintainability.

Below is an expanded overview of the `AI` directory for the CustomerInsight - Advanced Customer Portal application. The `AI` directory includes all the data science assets, such as machine learning models, data processing scripts, notebooks, and configuration files necessary for AI and ML operations.

```

### Notes:

- **AI/data_preparation:** Contains scripts or modules responsible for initial data cleaning, normalization, and transformation, getting the raw data ready for the next stages of the pipeline.

- **AI/feature_engineering:** This includes all the routines necessary for generating new features from the preprocessed data and possibly feature selection algorithms to reduce dimensionality.

- **AI/models:** Here you will find the model training and evaluation scripts. After training, the best-performing models are serialized (e.g., using Pickle for Python models) and stored in the `saved_models` directory. This might also contain versioning for models if needed.

- **AI/pipelines:** Pipelines combine several data processing and model training steps into a single iterable sequence, ensuring that the same sequence of transformations is applied during both training and inference.

- **AI/notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks are a great way to interactively explore the data and iteratively develop the machine learning model. Notebooks should be version controlled to preserve the exploration history.

- **AI/api:** Contains a sub-application strictly dedicated to serving AI models. This might include loading the serialized models, handling inference requests, and returning predictions.

- **AI/tests:** This section would include unit tests and integration tests for the AI components, testing data processing scripts, feature engineering methods, ML model prediction accuracy, edge cases, etc.

- **AI/config:** Configuration details for various models such as hyperparameters, feature lists, and model settings are stored here. Keeping these configurations separate from the code makes the models easier to tune.

- **AI/requirements.txt:** To avoid dependency conflicts with the rest of the application, the AI components may have their own set of dependencies listed in a separate `requirements.txt` file.

This AI directory layout ensures that data processing, model training, evaluation, and serving components are all logically separated but remain part of the overall CustomerInsight application. This structure is scalable and maintainable since each component can evolve independently as new features are developed or as models are updated and improved.

The `utils` or `lib` directory serves as a shared library where utility functions and common code are kept. This code is typically used across several components of the CustomerInsight - Advanced Customer Portal application. Organizing these reusable pieces of code in a central location helps in avoiding duplication, facilitating easier maintenance, and promoting a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) coding philosophy.

Below is a description of a potential structure for the `utils` directory:

```plaintext
/CustomerInsight-Portal
│
├── /lib or /utils    # Utilities directory
│   ├── /data_utils           # Helpers for data handling across services
│   │   ├── data_processing.py # General data processing functions

│       └── mocks.py              # Mock functions and objects
│
├── ... # Rest of the repository structure
```

### Notes:

- **lib/data_utils:** Contains functions and classes to handle common data manipulation tasks that are used by the ETL jobs, API endpoints, and AI components to preprocess and validate data.

- **lib/api_utils:** Houses utilities that provide common behaviors needed by the various API services like handling responses and managing request validation.

- **lib/logging:** Sets up a standardized approach to logging across all components, which is critical for monitoring and debugging in production environments.

- **lib/security:** Implements common security measures such as encryption, decryption, and authentication functions that can be integrated across services.

- **lib/config_loader:** A central place to manage the loading of various configuration files. This allows for a unified approach to manage configuration for all microservices and tools.

- **lib/ml_utils:** Provides helper functions related to managing the lifecycle of machine learning models, including loading serialized models, saving updates, and evaluating performance.

- **lib/performance:** Tools for measuring and tracking the performance of the system which can be used during development to benchmark and optimize the code.

- **lib/notification:** Integrates with email and SMS services to send notifications. These functions can be called to alert system administrators or end-users about critical system events or insights generated by AI components.

- **lib/test_helpers:** Contains shared utilities for writing tests, such as functions to create standardized test fixtures and mock objects to imitate system interfaces during testing.

By maintaining a `utils` or `lib` directory, you provide common ground for facilitating shared functionalities, reducing code duplication, and making the overall system more effective and easier to manage. It's important to keep the utilities well-documented and tested so that developers can understand and trust the shared codebase.

To handle the modularity of the CustomerInsight - Advanced Customer Portal application, we can create a service registry or a module loader file that keeps track of all the available modules and services. This file would act as a central point for managing the instantiation and dependency injection of various components of the system.

Here is an example of a module loader (or service registry) file:

File path: `/CustomerInsight-Portal/utils/module_loader.py`

```python
# module_loader.py

"""
ModuleLoader is responsible for loading and providing instances of the modular
components within the CustomerInsight - Advanced Customer Portal application.
"""

from dependency_injector import containers, providers
from services.customer_api.service import CustomerService
from services.insight_engine.service import InsightEngineService
from services.other_service.service import OtherService

# Import additional services or utilities as necessary
# from services.x import XService
# from lib.y import YUtility

class ModuleLoader(containers.DeclarativeContainer):
    """
    Container class for registering and instantiating all the required services
    and utilities with dependency injection.
    """

    config = providers.Configuration()

    # Service Providers
    customer_service = providers.Singleton(
        CustomerService,
        config=config.customer_api
    )

    insight_engine_service = providers.Singleton(
        InsightEngineService,
        config=config.insight_engine
    )

    other_service = providers.Singleton(
        OtherService,
        config=config.other_service
    )

    # Utility Providers (Add utilities that are injected into services)
    # y_utility = providers.Singleton(YUtility, config=config.y_utility)

    # Add additional service and utility providers below


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Loading configurations
    module_loader = ModuleLoader()
    module_loader.config.from_yaml('config/config.yml')

    # Accessing an instance of a service
    customer_service_instance = module_loader.customer_service()
    # The service can now be used in the application

```

In this example, `module_loader.py` uses the `dependency_injector` package, which provides dependency injection for Python. Each service, like `CustomerService`, `InsightEngineService`, and `OtherService`, is initialized with its respective configuration. Services or utilities that need to be shared across different parts of the application are registered within the `ModuleLoader` container class.

**How to use the `ModuleLoader` in practice:**

When a certain part of the application needs to use a service or a utility, it would retrieve the instance from the `ModuleLoader`. By doing this, you have a centralized place that manages module instances, and you make sure that every part of the application uses the same instance (singleton) unless explicitly configured otherwise. This helps in keeping the application modular and makes it easier to manage dependencies. 

Remember that the actual path and manner by which you store your configuration (`config/config.yml` in the example) will depend on your specific application setup and infrastructure.

By creating the `module_loader.py`, you ensure that each component of your application is isolated for testing, can be mocked or replaced as needed without major changes to the system, and follows a clean and modular architecture.

For the core logic of the CustomerInsight - Advanced Customer Portal application, we can establish a central module that encapsulates the primary business logic and processes underlying the application. This core module would interact with various services within the application to perform tasks such as data analytics, insights generation, and interfacing with the AI/ML components.

Here is an example of such a core logic handler:

File path: `/CustomerInsight-Portal/services/core/core_logic.py`

```python
# core_logic.py

"""
CoreLogicHandler is responsible for orchestrating the business logic and data
flow between different services and components of the CustomerInsight - Advanced
Customer Portal application.
"""

from services.customer_api.service import CustomerService
from services.insight_engine.service import InsightEngineService
from utils.data_utils import preprocess_data, validate_data

class CoreLogicHandler:
    def __init__(self, customer_service, insight_engine_service):
        self.customer_service = customer_service
        self.insight_engine_service = insight_engine_service

    def process_customer_data(self, data):
        # Preprocess the data
        preprocessed_data = preprocess_data(data)

        # Validate processed data
        if not validate_data(preprocessed_data):
            raise ValueError("Processed customer data validation failed.")

        # Send preprocessed data to the Customer Service for further operations
        customer_information = self.customer_service.process_data(preprocessed_data)
        return customer_information

    def generate_insights(self, customer_id):
        # Retrieve customer data
        customer_data = self.customer_service.get_customer_data(customer_id)

        # Generate insights using the Insight Engine Service
        insights = self.insight_engine_service.analyze_data(customer_data)
        return insights

    # Additional core logic functions can be added below to handle various application use cases


# Example use of the CoreLogicHandler
if __name__ == "__main__":
    customer_service = CustomerService()
    insight_engine_service = InsightEngineService()

    core_handler = CoreLogicHandler(customer_service, insight_engine_service)

    # Example data - this would normally come from an API request or another part of the application
    sample_data = {"customer_id": "123", "purchase_history": [], "interaction_data": {}}

    # Process customer data through the application's core logic
    customer_info = core_handler.process_customer_data(sample_data)

    # Generate customer insights
    customer_insights = core_handler.generate_insights(customer_info['customer_id'])

    # Other business logic can be performed using the core_handler instance
```

In this example, `core_logic.py` defines the `CoreLogicHandler` class, which acts as the heart of the application logic. It orchestrates the operations by calling upon pre-defined services like `CustomerService` for customer-related tasks and `InsightEngineService` for insight generation operations. The `CoreLogicHandler` also utilizes utility functions such as `preprocess_data` and `validate_data` from the `utils.data_utils` module to ensure data integrity before further processing.

To integrate this with the module loader structure from the previous example, one would use dependency injection to get instances of the services instead of instantiating them directly in the `__main__` block.

**Example Integration with `module_loader.py`:**

```python
from utils.module_loader import module_loader

# Load configurations and services using the module loader
module_loader.config.from_yaml('config/config.yml')

# Get instances of services from the module loader
customer_service_instance = module_loader.customer_service()
insight_engine_service_instance = module_loader.insight_engine_service()

# Instantiate the CoreLogicHandler with the service instances
core_handler = CoreLogicHandler(
    customer_service=customer_service_instance,
    insight_engine_service=insight_engine_service_instance
