```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def train_and_evaluate_model(data_file_path):
    ## Load mock data from a CSV file
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Preprocessing and feature engineering
    X = data.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
    y = data['target_variable']

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Instantiate and train a Random Forest classifier
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=3, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    ## Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    ## Evaluate model performance
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    return model, accuracy
```

In this function for the ContractAnalyzer AI application, `train_and_evaluate_model` accepts the file path to the mock data as input. It then loads the mock data from the specified CSV file, performs preprocessing and feature engineering, splits the data into training and testing sets, trains a Random Forest classifier, makes predictions on the test set, and evaluates the model's performance based on accuracy.

You would need to supply a CSV file path to the `data_file_path` parameter, containing mock data with features and a target variable for training the machine learning model in the ContractAnalyzer AI application.

```python
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

def train_and_evaluate_deep_learning_model(data_file_path):
    ## Load mock data from a CSV file
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Preprocessing and feature engineering
    X = data.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
    y = data['target_variable']

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Standardize the input features
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

    ## Build a deep learning model
    model = models.Sequential([
        layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
        layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

    ## Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    ## Evaluate model performance
    _, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)

    return model, accuracy
```

In this function for the ContractAnalyzer AI application, `train_and_evaluate_deep_learning_model` accepts the file path to the mock data as input. It then loads the mock data from the specified CSV file, performs preprocessing and feature engineering, splits the data into training and testing sets, standardizes the input features, builds a deep learning model using TensorFlow's Keras API, compiles and trains the model, and finally evaluates the model's performance based on accuracy.

You would need to supply a CSV file path to the `data_file_path` parameter, containing mock data with features and a target variable for training the deep learning model in the ContractAnalyzer AI application.
