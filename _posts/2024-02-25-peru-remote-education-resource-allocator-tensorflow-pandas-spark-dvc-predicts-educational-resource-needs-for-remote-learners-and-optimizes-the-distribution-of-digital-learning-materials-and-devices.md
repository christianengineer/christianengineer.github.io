I'll provide a Python script for training a TensorFlow model for the Peru Remote Education Resource Allocator using mock data.

```python
# File Path: src/model_training/train_model.py

import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Mock Data Generation
data = {
    'student_id': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'resource_usage': [0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.9, 0.6],
    'device_compatibility': [0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.7, 0.9],
    'resource_need': [0.6, 0.4, 0.2, 0.8, 0.5]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Feature and Target Split
X = df[['resource_usage', 'device_compatibility']]
y = df['resource_need']

# Data Preprocessing
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Train-Test Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# TensorFlow Model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='relu', input_shape=(2,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Model Training
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, verbose=1)

# Evaluation
loss = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test Loss: {loss}')

# Save trained model
model.save('models/tensorflow_models/resource_prediction_model.h5')
```

In this script:
- Mock data is generated for training the model.
- Features are normalized using StandardScaler.
- A simple TensorFlow neural network model is defined and trained on the mock data.
- The trained model is evaluated and saved for future use.

You can save this script in the specified file path: `src/model_training/train_model.py`.

```python
# File Path: src/model_training/train_complex_model.py

import pandas as pd
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
from pyspark.ml.regression import RandomForestRegressor
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import RegressionEvaluator
import dvc.api

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("ResourceAllocator").getOrCreate()

# Mock Data Location using DVC
data_url = dvc.api.get_url('data/mock_data.csv', repo='mock_data', rev='main')
df = spark.read.csv(data_url, header=True, inferSchema=True)

# Feature Engineering
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=['resource_usage', 'device_compatibility'], outputCol='features')
data = assembler.transform(df)

# Train-Test Split
train_data, test_data = data.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2])

# Random Forest Regressor
rf = RandomForestRegressor(featuresCol='features', labelCol='resource_need')
model = rf.fit(train_data)

# Model Evaluation
predictions = model.transform(test_data)
evaluator = RegressionEvaluator(labelCol='resource_need', predictionCol='prediction', metricName='rmse')
rmse = evaluator.evaluate(predictions)
print(f'Root Mean Squared Error: {rmse}')

# Save model and configuration
model.save('models/tensorflow_models/distribution_optimization_model')
model.write().overwrite().save('models/tensorflow_models/distribution_optimization_model')

# Stop Spark session
spark.stop()
```

In this script:
- A more complex machine learning algorithm, Random Forest Regressor, is trained using Spark MLlib.
- The script uses DVC to access mock data located in a separate repository.
- The data is preprocessed using VectorAssembler to prepare it for training.
- The Random Forest Regressor model is trained, evaluated, and saved for distribution optimization.
- The trained model and configuration are saved for future deployment.

Save this script in the specified file path: `src/model_training/train_complex_model.py`.
