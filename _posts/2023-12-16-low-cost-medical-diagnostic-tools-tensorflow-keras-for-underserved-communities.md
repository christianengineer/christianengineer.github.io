Certainly! Below is a Python script for training a machine learning model for the Low-Cost Medical Diagnostic Tools application using mock data. The script is named `train_model.py` and is located within the `src/models` directory of the project.

```python
## File path: Low-Cost-Medical-Diagnostic-Tools/src/models/train_model.py

import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

## Mock data (replace with actual data loading and preprocessing)
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 64, 64, 3)  ## Example input data
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)    ## Example target labels

## Define the model architecture (replace with actual model definition)
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

## Save the trained model and its architecture
model.save('model_weights.h5')  ## Save the trained weights
model.save('model_architecture.json', save_format='json')  ## Save the model architecture
```

In this example, the script initializes mock input data and model architecture for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, the `X_train` and `y_train` would be loaded from actual datasets, and the model architecture would be carefully designed based on the specific diagnostic task at hand.

The provided file path directly references the `train_model.py` script located within the `src/models` directory of the "Low-Cost-Medical-Diagnostic-Tools" project.

Certainly! Below is a Python script for a complex machine learning algorithm for the Low-Cost Medical Diagnostic Tools application using mock data. The script is named `complex_model.py` and is located within the `src/models` directory of the project.

```python
## File path: Low-Cost-Medical-Diagnostic-Tools/src/models/complex_model.py

import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

## Mock data (replace with actual data loading and preprocessing)
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 64, 64, 3)  ## Example input data
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)    ## Example target labels

## Define a complex model architecture (replace with actual model definition)
input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(64, 64, 3))
x = layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')(input_layer)
x = layers.MaxPooling2D(2)(x)
x = layers.Conv2D(64, 3, activation='relu')(x)
x = layers.MaxPooling2D(2)(x)
x = layers.Conv2D(64, 3, activation='relu')(x)
x = layers.Flatten()(x)
x = layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)
output_layer = layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(x)

## Create the model
model = keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

## Save the trained model and its architecture
model.save('complex_model_weights.h5')  ## Save the trained weights
model.save('complex_model_architecture.json', save_format='json')  ## Save the model architecture
```

In this example, the script demonstrates a more complex model architecture using Keras functional API, but the mock data is still used for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, the `X_train` and `y_train` would be loaded from actual datasets, and the model architecture would be designed based on the specific medical diagnostic task.

The provided file path directly references the `complex_model.py` script located within the `src/models` directory of the "Low-Cost-Medical-Diagnostic-Tools" project.
