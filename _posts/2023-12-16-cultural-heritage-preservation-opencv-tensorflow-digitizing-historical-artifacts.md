### Objectives
The main objectives of the AI Cultural Heritage Preservation project are to digitize and preserve historical artifacts through the use of computer vision and machine learning technologies. This includes tasks such as digitizing text and images from historical documents, categorizing and tagging artifacts, and creating a repository for digital preservation. The project aims to make these artifacts accessible to scholars, researchers, and the public while ensuring the preservation of cultural heritage.

### System Design Strategies
1. **Scalability and Performance**: To handle a large volume of historical artifacts, the system should be designed to scale horizontally. This involves using distributed computing frameworks and cloud services to handle the processing and storage requirements.

2. **Data-Intensive Processing**: Given the nature of historical artifacts, the system needs to efficiently manage and process large amounts of image and text data. This requires implementing data pipelines for preprocessing, feature extraction, and indexing.

3. **Machine Learning Model Serving**: Deploying machine learning models for tasks such as text recognition, object detection, and image classification will require a robust model serving infrastructure to ensure real-time or near-real-time inference.

4. **APIs and User Interface**: The system should provide APIs for integrating with external applications and a user interface for browsing and searching the digitized artifacts.

### Chosen Libraries and Frameworks
1. **OpenCV**: OpenCV is a popular open-source computer vision library that provides a wide range of tools for image processing, object detection, and feature extraction. It will be used for tasks such as image preprocessing, text extraction from images, and basic image analysis.

2. **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow is a powerful machine learning framework that offers a range of tools for training and deploying machine learning models. It will be used for tasks such as training models for image classification, object detection, and natural language processing.

3. **Distributed Computing Framework**: To address scalability and performance, a distributed computing framework such as Apache Spark or Dask may be used for parallel processing and distributed data manipulation.

4. **Cloud Services**: Leveraging cloud services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for scalable storage, computing, and machine learning infrastructure.

By leveraging these libraries and framework, the system will be well-equipped to handle the challenges of digitizing and preserving historical artifacts, while also making them accessible and useful through AI-powered capabilities.

### MLOps Infrastructure for Cultural Heritage Preservation

- **Model Packaging**: Leverage MLflow or TensorFlow Serving to package and serve the trained models as RESTful APIs or Docker containers.

#### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Use infrastructure as code tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to define and automate the deployment of scalable cloud resources for model serving and data storage.

#### Orchestration and Workflow Management
Leverage workflow management tools like Apache Airflow or Kubeflow to orchestrate and schedule data pipelines, model training, and deployment processes.

#### Monitoring and Logging
- **Model Monitoring**: Utilize tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring model performance, drift detection, and resource utilization.
- **Logging**: Implement centralized logging using ELK stack or similar tools to capture and analyze logs from the ML infrastructure components.

#### Experiment Tracking and Model Registry
- Use MLflow or similar platforms to track and manage experiments, model versions, and associated metadata.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a model for artifact classification using mock data. The script assumes the use of TensorFlow for model training and is intended to be located within the `model_training` directory of the Cultural Heritage Preservation application.

### File Path:
`Cultural_Heritage_Preservation/src/model_training/train_artifact_classification_model.py`

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Mock data for artifact classification training
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 32, 32, 3)  # Example: Random images with shape 32x32x3
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 5, size=100)  # Example: Random labels for artifact classes (0-4)

# Define and compile the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(5, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)

# Save the trained model
model.save('artifact_classification_model.h5')
```

In this example, the Python script `train_artifact_classification_model.py` demonstrates the process of training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for artifact classification. It uses mock data (randomly generated arrays) for the purpose of illustration. The trained model is then saved in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) file format (`artifact_classification_model.h5`).

This file would be located within the `model_training` directory of the Cultural Heritage Preservation application.

The script assumes the use of TensorFlow for model training and is intended to be located within the `model_training` directory of the Cultural Heritage Preservation application.

### File Path:
`Cultural_Heritage_Preservation/src/model_training/train_complex_model.py`

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Mock data for image classification training
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 128, 128, 3)  # Example: Random images with shape 128x128x3
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 5, size=100)  # Example: Random labels for artifact classes (0-4)

# Define and compile the complex CNN model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(128, 128, 3)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(5, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the complex CNN model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20)

# Save the trained model
model.save('complex_artifact_classification_model.h5')
```

In this example, the Python script `train_complex_model.py` demonstrates the process of training a complex CNN model for image classification using mock data (randomly generated arrays) for the purpose of illustration. The trained model is then saved in the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) file format (`complex_artifact_classification_model.h5`).

This file would be located within the `model_training` directory of the Cultural Heritage Preservation application.
