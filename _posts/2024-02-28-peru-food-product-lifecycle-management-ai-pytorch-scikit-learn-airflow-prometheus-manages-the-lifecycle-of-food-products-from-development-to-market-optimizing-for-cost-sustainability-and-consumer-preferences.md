### Training Script for Peru Food Product Lifecycle Management AI

Below is a sample training script for training a PyTorch model for demand forecasting using mock data in the Peru Food Product Lifecycle Management AI application.

### File Path:
**Peru_Food_Product_Lifecycle_AI/scripts/train_demand_forecasting_model.py**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np

# Mock Data Generation
np.random.seed(42)
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 5)  # Mock features
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 100, 100)  # Mock target variable

# Convert mock data to PyTorch tensors
X_train_tensor = torch.tensor(X_train, dtype=torch.float32)
y_train_tensor = torch.tensor(y_train, dtype=torch.float32)

# Define PyTorch model architecture
class DemandForecastingModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(DemandForecastingModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(5, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

# Initialize model and optimizer
model = DemandForecastingModel()
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Model Training
num_epochs = 100
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(X_train_tensor)
    loss = criterion(outputs, y_train_tensor.view(-1, 1))
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    
    if (epoch+1) % 10 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item()}')

# Save trained model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'models/pytorch_models/demand_forecasting_model.pt')
```

This script generates mock data, defines a simple PyTorch model for demand forecasting, and trains the model using the mock data. The trained model is then saved in the `Peru_Food_Product_Lifecycle_AI/models/pytorch_models` directory for later deployment and use within the application.

### Complex Machine Learning Algorithm Script for Peru Food Product Lifecycle Management AI

Below is a sample script for training a complex machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) using Scikit-Learn with mock data in the Peru Food Product Lifecycle Management AI application.

### File Path:
**Peru_Food_Product_Lifecycle_AI/scripts/train_complex_algorithm.py**

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import joblib

# Mock Data Generation
np.random.seed(42)
X = np.random.rand(100, 10)  # Mock features
y = np.random.randint(0, 100, 100)  # Mock target variable

# Split data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the Random Forest model
rf_model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate and print the Mean Squared Error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')

# Save the trained model
joblib.dump(rf_model, 'models/sklearn_models/complex_algorithm_model.pkl')
```

This script creates mock data, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a Random Forest regression model using Scikit-Learn, evaluates the model performance on the test set, and saves the trained model in the `Peru_Food_Product_Lifecycle_AI/models/sklearn_models` directory. This complex algorithm can be used for tasks such as product quality prediction or consumer behavior analysis within the food product lifecycle management application.
