Sure, I can provide a Python function that represents a complex machine learning algorithm for the MarketMover - AI for Digital Marketing application, using mock data. For this example, let's consider a hypothetical scenario where we are building a deep learning model for customer behavior prediction.

First, let's create mock data files for training and testing the model. We can use CSV files for this purpose. Here's an example file path:

```plaintext
data/
├── training_data.csv    # Mock training data file
└── testing_data.csv     # Mock testing data file
```

Now, let's define a Python function for the deep learning model in a file named `customer_behavior_prediction_model.py`:

```python
# customer_behavior_prediction_model.py

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout

def train_customer_behavior_model(training_data_path, testing_data_path):
    # Load mock training data
    training_data = pd.read_csv(training_data_path)

    # Preprocess the data
    X = training_data.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
    y = training_data['target_variable']
    X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Scale the data
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_val = scaler.transform(X_val)

    # Build the deep learning model
    model = Sequential([
        Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
        Dropout(0.3),
        Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        Dropout(0.2),
        Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_val, y_val), epochs=50, batch_size=64)

    # Evaluate the model on mock testing data
    testing_data = pd.read_csv(testing_data_path)
    X_test = testing_data.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
    y_test = testing_data['target_variable']
    X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
    _, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)

    return model, accuracy
```

In this function, we are using mock data to train and evaluate a deep learning model for predicting customer behavior. The function accepts paths to the mock training and testing data files, loads the data using Pandas, preprocesses and scales the data, builds a sequential deep learning model using TensorFlow's Keras API, trains the model, and evaluates its accuracy on the mock testing data.

This function demonstrates a complex machine learning algorithm that can be used within the MarketMover - AI for Digital Marketing application, specifically for customer behavior prediction.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python function that represents a complex deep learning algorithm for the MarketMover - AI for Digital Marketing application using mock data. For this example, let's assume we are building a deep learning model for product recommendation.

└── product_recommendation_testing_data.csv       # Mock testing data file
```

Now, let's define a Python function for the deep learning model in a file named `product_recommendation_model.py`:

```python

    # Apply label encoding for categorical features
    user_encoder = LabelEncoder()
    product_encoder = LabelEncoder()
    X['user_id'] = user_encoder.fit_transform(X['user_id'])
    X['product_id'] = product_encoder.fit_transform(X['product_id'])

    # Split the data into training and validation sets
    X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Define the deep learning model architecture
    num_users = len(user_encoder.classes_)
    num_products = len(product_encoder.classes_)
    user_input = Input(shape=(1,))
    product_input = Input(shape=(1,))

    user_embedded = Embedding(num_users, 50, input_length=1)(user_input)
    product_embedded = Embedding(num_products, 50, input_length=1)(product_input)

    user_flattened = Flatten()(user_embedded)
    product_flattened = Flatten()(product_embedded)

    concatenated = Concatenate()([user_flattened, product_flattened])
    dense1 = Dense(128, activation='relu')(concatenated)
    dense2 = Dense(64, activation='relu')(dense1)
    output = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(dense2)

    model = Model(inputs=[user_input, product_input], outputs=output)

    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    # Train the model
    model.fit([X_train['user_id'], X_train['product_id']], y_train, validation_data=([X_val['user_id'], X_val['product_id']], y_val), epochs=10, batch_size=64)

    # Evaluate the model on mock testing data
    testing_data = pd.read_csv(testing_data_path)
    X_test = testing_data[['user_id', 'product_id']]
    y_test = testing_data['purchase_label']
    X_test['user_id'] = user_encoder.transform(X_test['user_id'])
    X_test['product_id'] = product_encoder.transform(X_test['product_id'])
    _, accuracy = model.evaluate([X_test['user_id'], X_test['product_id']], y_test)

    return model, accuracy
```

In this function, we are building a deep learning model for product recommendation using mock data. The function accepts paths to the mock training and testing data files, loads the data using Pandas, preprocesses the data by applying label encoding to categorical features, builds a deep learning model using TensorFlow's Keras API, trains the model, and evaluates its accuracy on the mock testing data.
