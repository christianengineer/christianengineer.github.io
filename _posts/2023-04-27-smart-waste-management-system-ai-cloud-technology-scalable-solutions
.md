## Smart Waste Management System

## Description

The Smart Waste Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to modernize and streamline the processes related to waste management. This innovative system will employ cutting-edge technology aimed at improving waste collecting efficiency, increasing recycling rates, reducing overall environmental impact, and lessening operational costs. It will leverage concepts of IoT, Cloud Computing, and Big Data to enable automated waste tracking, real-time data analysis, and optimized operational decision-making.

## Goals

1. **Optimized Waste Collection**: Using IoT-enabled devices to track waste levels and predict collection needs to avoid overflows and underused pick-ups.
2. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Utilising real-time data to enhance operational decisions, improve route planning and resource allocation.
3. **Environmental Impact Reduction**: By optimizing routes and improving recycling initiatives, we aim for significant reductions in carbon emissions and environmental impact.
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Reducing operational costs by avoiding unnecessary trips, reducing fuel consumption, and decreasing wear and tear on vehicles.
5. **Improve Recycling Rates**: Data analytics would offer insights into recycling trends, helping to target educational campaigns and incentives better.

## Technical Stack & Libraries

This project will implement a full-stack development approach. Here are some technologies and libraries we plan to use to efficiently handle data and user traffic:

### Back-end

1. **Node.js & Express.js**: We will use JavaScript-based technologies for server-side operations. Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications while Express.js is a robust tool to build web applications.

2. **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that will store our data. It's excellent for handling large amounts of data and provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability.

3. **Mongoose**: A MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. It provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model our application data.

### Front-end

1. **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's efficient, flexible, and a component-based approach makes it suitable for fast and interactive UI design.

2. **Redux**: It's used for managing application state. It will help our app to have consistent performance, run in different environments and be easy to test.

### Data Handling

1. **Socket.IO**: For real-time bidirectional communication. It's very efficient in handling multiple concurrent connections.

2. **Nginx**: An open-source software to serve as a reverse proxy server for better load balancing and handling user traffic.

3. **RabbitMQ**: An open-source message-broker software that offers robust messaging for applications.

### DevOps

1. **Docker**: For containerization of our application, enhancing scalability and reliability.

2. **Kubernetes**: To orchestrate our Docker containers, handle workloads, optimize infrastructure.

3. **Jenkins**: For implementing robust continuous integration/continuous delivery pipelines to ensure smooth deployment.

By implementing the Smart Waste Management System, we hope to revolutionize waste management processes, introduce greater efficiency, and ultimately contribute to a more sustainable future.

## Smart Waste Management System - Repository File Structure

The Smart Waste Management System should have a organized and scalable file structure for easier maintenance and version control. Below is a proposed structure.

```
Smart-Waste-Management-System/
│
├── frontend/
│   ├── public/
│   │   ├── index.html
│   │   ├── favicon.ico
│   │   ├── manifest.json
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── containers/
│   │   ├── actions/
│   │   ├── reducers/
│   │   ├── App.js
│   │   ├── index.js
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── .gitignore
│
├── backend/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── routes/
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── db.js
│   ├── server.js
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── .gitignore
│
├── data/
│   ├── DummyData.js
│
├── .gitignore
├── Dockerfile
├── README.md
└── package.json
```

- `frontend/` directory contains all the code related to the UI of the system built using React.js.

- `public/` directory consists of static files like `index.html`, `favicon.ico`(the icon in the title bar of the browser), and `manifest.json`.

- `src/` directory contains the main React application. `components/` where the individual components (e.g. header, footer, a button etc.) are stored. `containers/` hold larger components which may contain other components and business logic. `actions/` and `reducers/` are for Redux state management.

- `backend/` directory stores the server-side Node.js and Express.js application.

- `models/` directory contains the data models (or schemas) for MongoDB. `routes/` houses the route handlers (based on URL) while `controllers/` contains business logic.

- `data/` directory stores any dummy/test data for the system.

- `Dockerfile` includes instructions on how Docker should build our custom image.

- `README.md` will be used to present necessary information about the project including ‘how to run the application’, ‘file structure’, ‘contribution guidelines’ etc.

## Smart Waste Management System - Backend Logic (Fictitious)

Let's assume we are working on the main logic for managing the waste data received from the IoT devices. The file could be located in the `controllers` folder in the `backend` directory.

**Location**: `backend/controllers/wasteManagementController.js`

```javascript
/** @file backend/controllers/wasteManagementController.js */

// Import necessary requirements
const WasteDataModel = require("../models/WasteDataModel");
const PredictionModel = require("../models/PredictionModel");

exports.processWasteData = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Parse data from request body
    const wasteData = req.body;

    // Save data to the database
    const newWasteData = new WasteDataModel(wasteData);
    await newWasteData.save();

    // Process data and predict the future waste production based on past data
    const prediction = PredictWasteProduction(newWasteData);
    const newPrediction = new PredictionModel(prediction);
    await newPrediction.save();

    res
      .status(200)
      .send({ message: "Waste data processed and prediction made" });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    res
      .status(500)
      .send({ message: "An error occurred while processing the waste data" });
  }
};

function PredictWasteProduction(wasteData) {
  /**
   * @todo Implement wasteData analytics and prediction logic here.
   * This function is responsible for analyzing the received waste data
   * and make some predictions about future waste production based on the past data.
   */
}
```

This is a basic controller which handles processing of the incoming waste data. It leverages MongoDB for storing data and implements a placeholder function `PredictWasteProduction` for future data analytics and prediction logic. Error handling is embedded to capture unexpected behavior. This file structure adheres a modern, maintainable, and scalable software architecture.
