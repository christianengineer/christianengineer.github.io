I will provide a Python script for training a model using mock data for the Educational Content Delivery Network for Peru that optimizes the delivery of educational content over low-bandwidth connections. This script will leverage BERT and GPT-3 models for content analysis and optimization. Below is the content of the script:

```python
## train_model.py

import pandas as pd
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification, GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel
import torch

## Load mock data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'text': ['Sample text 1', 'Sample text 2', 'Sample text 3'],
    'label': [0, 1, 0]  ## Sample labels for classification task
})

## Initialize BERT model and tokenizer
bert_model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=2)
bert_tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

## Tokenize input text for BERT
inputs = bert_tokenizer(list(data['text']), padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')

## Train BERT model
bert_model.train()
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(bert_model.parameters(), lr=5e-5)

for epoch in range(3):  ## Example of 3 training epochs
    outputs = bert_model(**inputs, labels=torch.tensor(data['label']).unsqueeze(1))
    loss = outputs.loss
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

## Initialize GPT-3 model and tokenizer
gpt3_model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')
gpt3_tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')

## Generate text with GPT-3
generated_text = gpt3_model.generate(gpt3_tokenizer("Input prompt for text generation", return_tensors='pt')

## Save trained models
bert_model.save_pretrained('models/BERT_model')
gpt3_model.save_pretrained('models/GPT-3_model')
```

In this script:

- We load mock data into a DataFrame for training the BERT model.
- Initialize and train a BERT model for sequence classification using the mock data.
- Initialize and generate text using the GPT-3 model.
- Save the trained BERT and GPT-3 models to the 'models/' directory.

You can run this script by executing it in a Python environment with the required dependencies installed. Save the script as 'train_model.py' in the root directory of your project.

I will provide a Python script for a complex machine learning algorithm that leverages BERT and GPT-3 models within the Educational Content Delivery Network for Peru. This algorithm will optimize the delivery of educational content over low-bandwidth connections using mock data. Below is the content of the script:

import torch
import requests

## Load mock data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'text': ['Sample text 1', 'Sample text 2', 'Sample text 3'],
    'label': [0, 1, 0]  ## Sample labels for classification task
})

## Initialize BERT model and tokenizer
bert_model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=2)
bert_tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

## Tokenize input text for BERT
inputs = bert_tokenizer(list(data['text']), padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')

## Train BERT model
bert_model.train()
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(bert_model.parameters(), lr=5e-5)

for epoch in range(3):  ## Example of 3 training epochs
    outputs = bert_model(**inputs, labels=torch.tensor(data['label']).unsqueeze(1))
    loss = outputs.loss
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

## Initialize GPT-3 model and tokenizer
gpt3_model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')
gpt3_tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')

## Generate text with GPT-3
generated_text = gpt3_model.generate(gpt3_tokenizer("Input prompt for text generation", return_tensors='pt')

## Implement complex algorithm using BERT and GPT-3 models
## Example: analyzing text data with BERT, processing results, and generating content with GPT-3

## Send results to Kafka for message streaming
kafka_url = 'http://kafka-server:9092'
requests.post(kafka_url, data={'result': 'complex algorithm results'})

## Monitor algorithm performance with Prometheus
## Example: track algorithm metrics and monitor resource usage

## Save trained models
bert_model.save_pretrained('models/BERT_model')
gpt3_model.save_pretrained('models/GPT-3_model')
```
