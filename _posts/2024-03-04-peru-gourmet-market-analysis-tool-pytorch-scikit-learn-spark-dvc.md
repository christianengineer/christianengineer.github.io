## Generate mocked data for market analysis
np.random.seed(42)

## Create a fictitious dataset with mock features
num_samples = 10000

data = pd.DataFrame({
    'customer_id': np.arange(1, num_samples + 1),
    'age': np.random.randint(18, 65, num_samples),
    'gender': np.random.choice(['Male', 'Female'], num_samples),

    'transaction_amount': np.random.normal(100, 20, num_samples),
    'visit_frequency': np.random.randint(1, 10, num_samples),
    'satisfaction_score': np.random.randint(1, 5, num_samples)
})

## Save mock data to CSV file
data.to_csv('mocked_market_data.csv', index=False)
```

This Python script generates a fictitious mocked dataset for market analysis. It includes features such as customer ID, age, gender, income, transaction amount, visit frequency, and satisfaction score. The data is saved to a CSV file named `mocked_market_data.csv`.

You can adjust the parameters such as the range for age, income, and the distribution of other features to create a larger or more detailed dataset as needed for modeling purposes.

Here is a small example of mocked data in a tabular format that is ready for modeling:

| customer_id | age | gender | income | transaction_amount | visit_frequency | satisfaction_score |
| ----------- | --- | ------ | ------ | ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------ |
| 1           | 35  | Male   | 60000  | 95                 | 3               | 4                  |
| 2           | 45  | Female | 80000  | 110                | 5               | 3                  |
| 3           | 28  | Female | 40000  | 85                 | 2               | 2                  |
| 4           | 50  | Male   | 100000 | 120                | 4               | 5                  |

This example dataset includes a small number of fictitious records with features like customer ID, age, gender, income, transaction amount, visit frequency, and satisfaction score. Each row represents a customer with corresponding attribute values that can be used for training and testing machine learning models for market analysis or consumer behavior predictions.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

## Load the mocked data
data = pd.read_csv('mocked_market_data.csv')

## Define features and target variable
X = data[['age', 'income', 'transaction_amount', 'visit_frequency', 'satisfaction_score']]
y = data['gender']  ## Predicting gender as an example

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Initialize and train a Random Forest Classifier
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)

## Calculate accuracy of the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Model Accuracy: {accuracy}')

## Save the trained model for deployment
import joblib
joblib.dump(rf_model, 'gender_prediction_model.pkl')
```

This production-ready Python code utilizes a Random Forest Classifier to train a model on the mocked market data. The model predicts the `gender` of customers based on features such as `age`, `income`, `transaction_amount`, `visit_frequency`, and `satisfaction_score`.

The code loads the data, splits it into training and testing sets, trains the model, evaluates its accuracy, and saves the trained model as a `.pkl` file for deployment. Adjust the features and target variable as needed for your specific market analysis or predictive modeling task.
