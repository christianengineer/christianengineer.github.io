Sure, here's an example of a training script for the TensorFlow model using mock data:

### File: models/tensorflow/training_scripts/train_model.py

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from models.tensorflow.model_architecture import create_model
from data.data_preprocessing import preprocess_data
from utils.data_loader import load_mock_training_data
from utils.model_evaluation import evaluate_model

# File Paths
TRAINING_DATA_PATH = 'data/processed/mock_training_data.csv'
SAVED_MODEL_PATH = 'models/tensorflow/model_artifacts/mock_model'

# Load mock training data
X, y = load_mock_training_data(TRAINING_DATA_PATH)

# Preprocess the data
X_processed = preprocess_data(X)

# Create and compile the TensorFlow model
model = create_model()
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_processed, y, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

# Save the trained model
model.save(SAVED_MODEL_PATH)

# Evaluate the model
evaluate_model(model, X_processed, y)
```

In this script, we:
- Import necessary libraries for model creation and training.
- Define file paths for the mock training data and the location to save the trained model.
- Load mock training data using a utility function `load_mock_training_data` from the `utils` module.
- Preprocess the mock data using a data preprocessing function `preprocess_data`.
- Create a TensorFlow model using the `create_model` function from `model_architecture` module.
- Compile, train, and save the trained model.
- Evaluate the model's performance using the `evaluate_model` function.

To ensure the successful execution of this script, it assumes the presence of various utility functions for data loading, preprocessing, model creation, and evaluation in their respective locations within the project's directory structure.

Please note that the specific implementation details for model architecture, data preprocessing, data loading, and model evaluation functions are abstracted here for brevity.

The provided file path for the training script is: `mental_health_monitoring_app/models/tensorflow/training_scripts/train_model.py`

Let me know if you need a similar script for the NLTK model or any further assistance!

Certainly! Below is an example of a file that contains a complex machine learning algorithm for the TensorFlow model using mock data:

### File: models/tensorflow/training_scripts/complex_algorithm_train_model.py

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from models.tensorflow.model_architecture import create_complex_model
from data.data_preprocessing import preprocess_complex_data
from utils.data_loader import load_mock_complex_training_data
from utils.model_evaluation import evaluate_model

# File Paths
TRAINING_DATA_PATH = 'data/processed/mock_complex_training_data.csv'
SAVED_MODEL_PATH = 'models/tensorflow/model_artifacts/complex_model'

# Load mock complex training data
X, y = load_mock_complex_training_data(TRAINING_DATA_PATH)

# Preprocess the complex data
X_processed = preprocess_complex_data(X)

# Create and compile the complex TensorFlow model
model = create_complex_model()
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model with more complex configurations
model.fit(X_processed, y, epochs=50, batch_size=64, validation_split=0.2, callbacks=[early_stopping, tensorboard])

# Save the trained complex model
model.save(SAVED_MODEL_PATH)

# Evaluate the performance of the complex model
evaluate_model(model, X_processed, y)
```

In this script, we:
- Import necessary libraries for model creation and training.
- Define file paths for the mock complex training data and the location to save the trained complex model.
- Load mock complex training data using a utility function `load_mock_complex_training_data` from the `utils` module.
