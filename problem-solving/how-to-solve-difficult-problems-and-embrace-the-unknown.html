    <h1>How to Solve Difficult Problems and Embrace the Unknown</h1>
    <p>Are you currently grappling with a challenging problem? The path to solving intricate issues involves answering
        key questions and engaging in tangible actions. Here's a method to guide you:</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Define the Problem and Impact</h2>
    <p>Answer the following questions to gain insight into the problem:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>What does the solution look like?</li>
        <li>Where, what, or whom does this solution impact?</li>
        <li>What can you learn from the journey while arriving at this solution?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Upon reflecting on the third question, you'll recognize the actual benefits you'll gain by working towards a
        solution. Suddenly, the thought of giving up will recede.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Identify the Next Physical Action</h2>
    <p>Let's begin:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pick one of the insights you listed for question 3.</li>
        <li>Now answer this question: <strong>What is the next physical action I can take to make the smallest amount of
                progress?</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>To Learn JavaScript</h3>
    <p>Follow these physical actions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>With your hand, move your mouse cursor to your preferred browser icon.</li>
        <li>Click to open a new browser window.</li>
        <li>Position your fingers on the keyboard.</li>
        <li>Type "How to print hello world in JavaScript" into the search field.</li>
        <li>Press 'Enter' to initiate the search.</li>
        <li>Navigate to a relevant tutorial or guide.</li>
        <li>Read the instructions on printing "Hello, World!" in JavaScript, following any code examples provided.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>To Learn DevOps</h3>
    <p>Follow these physical actions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>With your hand, move your mouse cursor to your preferred browser icon.</li>
        <li>Press your mouse button to click and open a new browser window.</li>
        <li>Place your fingers on the keyboard.</li>
        <li>Type "DevOps Categories" into the search field of the browser.</li>
        <li>Press the 'Enter' key with your finger to initiate the search.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Step 3: Continue Making Progress</h2>
    <p>After completing the first physical action, ask yourself a slightly modified question:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What is the next physical action that I can take to keep making progress?</strong></li>
    </ul>
