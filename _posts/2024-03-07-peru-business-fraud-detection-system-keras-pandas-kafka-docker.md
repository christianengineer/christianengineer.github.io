# Data Preprocessing Strategies for Peru Business Fraud Detection System

## Specific Data Problems
1. **Imbalanced Classes:** The dataset may contain significantly more non-fraudulent transactions than fraudulent ones, leading to class imbalance issues.
2. **Missing Values:** Incomplete or missing data entries in certain features can affect model performance and predictive accuracy.
3. **Outliers:** Outliers in transaction amounts or frequencies might distort the distribution of data and impact the model's ability to detect fraudulent activities accurately.
4. **Non-Standardized Timestamps:** Inconsistent timestamp formats or time zone discrepancies could hinder the model's ability to capture time-based patterns effectively.

## Data Preprocessing Strategies
1. **Class Imbalance Handling:**
   - Implement oversampling techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the classes.
   - Utilize class weights during model training to give higher importance to the minority class.

2. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - Impute missing values using methods like mean, median, or mode imputation based on the nature of the feature.
   - Drop rows or columns with excessive missing data if they do not contribute significantly to the model.

3. **Outlier Treatment:**
   - Use robust statistical methods like Z-score or IQR to detect and filter out outliers in transaction amounts or frequencies.
   - Consider transforming skewed data distributions using techniques like log transformation.

4. **Standardizing Timestamps:**
   - Convert all timestamps to a consistent format and time zone to ensure uniformity for time-based feature extraction.
   - Leverage feature engineering to extract additional time-related features that account for different time intervals or periodicities.

## Unique Project Demands
- **Country-Specific Fraud Patterns:** Tailor data preprocessing steps to address fraud patterns prevalent in Peru, such as specific merchant categories or transaction types commonly associated with fraud.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensure data preprocessing adheres to relevant regulations and compliance standards in Peru regarding data privacy and security to maintain data integrity and trustworthiness.

By strategically employing these data preprocessing practices aligned with the unique demands of the Peru Business Fraud Detection System, businesses can mitigate common data problems, enhance data quality, and prepare a robust dataset conducive to building high-performing machine learning models for fraud detection in the Peruvian business landscape.

Certainly! Below is a Python code file outlining the necessary preprocessing steps tailored to the unique needs of the Peru Business Fraud Detection System. Each preprocessing step is accompanied by comments explaining its significance in preparing the data for effective model training and analysis.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv("transaction_data.csv")

# Step 1: Handling Missing Values
# Impute missing values in numerical features with median and categorical features with most frequent value
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='median')
data[['transaction_amount']] = imputer.fit_transform(data[['transaction_amount']])
data[['merchant_category']] = imputer.fit_transform(data[['merchant_category']])

# Step 2: Standardizing Numerical Features
# Scale numerical features like transaction_amount to have zero mean and unit variance
scaler = StandardScaler()
data[['transaction_amount']] = scaler.fit_transform(data[['transaction_amount']])

# Step 3: Handling Class Imbalance with SMOTE
# Apply SMOTE to oversample the minority class (fraudulent transactions)
X = data.drop('fraud_label', axis=1)
y = data['fraud_label']
smote = SMOTE()
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)
data_resampled = pd.concat([X_resampled, y_resampled], axis=1)
```

In this code snippet:
- **Step 1** addresses missing values by imputing median values for numerical features (such as transaction_amount) and the most frequent values for categorical features (like merchant_category).
- **Step 2** standardizes numerical features (e.g., transaction_amount) using StandardScaler to ensure consistent scaling for model training.
- **Step 3** implements SMOTE to handle class imbalance, oversampling the minority class (fraudulent transactions) to address the imbalanced dataset.

These preprocessing steps are crucial in preparing the data for model training, ensuring robustness, reliability, and optimal performance of the machine learning model in detecting fraud in the Peruvian business context. Adjust the code as needed based on the specific characteristics of your dataset and preprocessing requirements.

To generate a large fictitious dataset that mimics real-world data relevant to the Peru Business Fraud Detection System, you can use Python along with libraries like Pandas and NumPy for dataset creation and Scikit-learn for data validation. Below is a Python script demonstrating how to create a fictitious dataset with attributes aligned with the project's features and guidelines to incorporate real-world variability:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

# Generate fictitious dataset with features relevant to fraud detection
n_samples = 10000
n_features = 10

X, y = make_classification(n_samples=n_samples, n_features=n_features, n_classes=2, 
                           weights=[0.99, 0.01], random_state=42)

# Create Pandas DataFrame with simulated data
columns = ['transaction_amount', 'transaction_frequency', 'time_of_transaction', 
           'merchant_category_code', 'normalized_amount', 'hour_of_day', 
           'day_of_week', 'avg_amount_per_account', 'total_transactions',
           'max_amount_per_account', 'fraud_label']
data = pd.DataFrame(data=X, columns=columns)
data['fraud_label'] = y
