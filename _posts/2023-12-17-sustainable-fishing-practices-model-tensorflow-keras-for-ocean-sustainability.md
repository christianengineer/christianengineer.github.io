Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a model for the Sustainable Fishing Practices Model using mock data. The script uses TensorFlow and Keras for model development and training.

**File Path:**
```plaintext
src/model/train_model.py
```

**train_model.py:**
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Load mock data (Replace this with actual data loading code)
# Mock environmental and catch data
environmental_data = pd.DataFrame({'temperature': [20, 25, 30, 22], 'salinity': [35, 32, 34, 33]})
catch_data = pd.DataFrame({'species': ['cod', 'haddock', 'cod', 'haddock'], 'weight_kg': [10, 8, 12, 7]})

# Preprocess mock data (Replace this with actual data preprocessing code)
# Example: Normalize environmental features and one-hot encode catch species
normalized_environmental_data = (environmental_data - environmental_data.mean()) / environmental_data.std()
encoded_catch_data = pd.get_dummies(catch_data['species'])

# Define the model architecture
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(normalized_environmental_data.shape[1],)),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(encoded_catch_data.shape[1], activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model using the mock data
model.fit(normalized_environmental_data, encoded_catch_data, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

# Save the trained model
model.save('models/trained_model_mock.h5')

# Serialize model architecture to JSON
with open('models/model_architecture_mock.json', 'w') as f:
    f.write(model.to_json())

# Save model weights
model.save_weights('models/model_weights_mock.h5')
```

In this Python script, the mock data for environmental and catch data is used for training a simple neural network model. The trained model, model architecture, and model weights are saved in the `models/` directory within the project structure.

This script serves as a starting point for training the Sustainable Fishing Practices Model using TensorFlow and Keras, and can be further expanded upon with real data and more complex model architectures.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for implementing a complex machine learning algorithm (e.g., a deep learning model) for the Sustainable Fishing Practices Model using mock data. The script utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for model development.

**File Path:**
```plaintext
src/model/complex_machine_learning_algorithm.py
```

**complex_machine_learning_algorithm.py:**
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Load mock data (Replace this with actual data loading code)
# Mock environmental and catch data
environmental_data = pd.DataFrame({'temperature': [20, 25, 30, 22], 'salinity': [35, 32, 34, 33]})
catch_data = pd.DataFrame({'species': ['cod', 'haddock', 'cod', 'haddock'], 'weight_kg': [10, 8, 12, 7]})

# Preprocess mock data (Replace this with actual data preprocessing code)
# Example: Normalize environmental features and encode catch species
scaler = StandardScaler()
normalized_environmental_data = scaler.fit_transform(environmental_data)
encoded_catch_data = pd.get_dummies(catch_data['species'])

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(normalized_environmental_data, encoded_catch_data, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define a complex deep learning model
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.5),
    layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(y_train.shape[1], activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model using the mock data
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(np.argmax(y_test, axis=1), np.argmax(y_pred, axis=1)))

# Save the trained model
model.save('models/trained_complex_model_mock.h5')

# Serialize model architecture to JSON
with open('models/complex_model_architecture_mock.json', 'w') as f:
    f.write(model.to_json())

# Save model weights
model.save_weights('models/complex_model_weights_mock.h5')
```

In this Python script, a more complex deep learning model is defined and trained using the mock environmental and catch data. The trained complex model, model architecture, and model weights are saved in the `models/` directory within the project structure.

This script serves as an example of implementing a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm using TensorFlow and Keras for the Sustainable Fishing Practices Model, and can be further customized and optimized when real data becomes available.
