Here's an example file for training a named entity recognition (NER) model for the AI-Powered Legal Document Analysis using SpaCy with mock data. This file can be placed within the modeling directory of the source code (as per the previously provided file structure) under the name `train_ner_model.py`.

```python
# train_ner_model.py
import spacy
import random
import json

# Load mock training data
with open('data/processed/mock_training_data.json', 'r') as file:
    mock_training_data = json.load(file)

# Initialize a blank SpaCy NLP pipeline
nlp = spacy.blank("en")

# Create a new entity type for legal entities
nlp.entity.add_label('LEGAL_ENTITY')

# Initialize the NER component
ner = nlp.create_pipe("ner")
nlp.add_pipe(ner, last=True)

# Add mock training examples to the NER component
for _, annotations in mock_training_data:
    for ent in annotations.get('entities'):
        ner.add_label(ent[2])

# Other components could be added to the pipeline such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, etc.

# Disable other pipes during training
other_pipes = [pipe for pipe in nlp.pipe_names if pipe != 'ner']
with nlp.disable_pipes(*other_pipes):
    # Begin training the NER model
    optimizer = nlp.begin_training()
    for itn in range(10):  # Example: 10 iterations
        random.shuffle(mock_training_data)
        losses = {}
        for text, annotations in mock_training_data:
            nlp.update(
                [text],  # batch of texts
                [annotations],  # batch of annotations
                drop=0.5,  # dropout - make it harder to memorize data
                sgd=optimizer,  # the optimizer
                losses=losses)
        print(losses)

# Save the trained model to disk
nlp.to_disk('models/spacy/entity_recognition/ner_legal_entity_model')
```

In this example, the file `train_ner_model.py` is responsible for training a named entity recognition (NER) model using SpaCy on mock training data. The mock training data is assumed to be stored in a JSON file named `mock_training_data.json` within the `data/processed/` directory.

The NER model is trained to recognize entities relevant to legal documents, utilizing a blank SpaCy pipeline and incorporating the mock training examples. After training, the resulting model is saved to the directory `models/spacy/entity_recognition/` as `ner_legal_entity_model`.

This file demonstrates a simplified training process using mock data, but in a real-world scenario, it would involve more extensive data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and potentially a validation dataset. Additionally, the training file would be complemented by additional documentation, testing, and management as part of a comprehensive MLOps pipeline.

Keep in mind that the actual structure and code may vary based on the specific approach, data, and requirements of the AI-Powered Legal Document Analysis application.

Below is an example file for a complex machine learning algorithm, such as a legal document classifier, for the AI-Powered Legal Document Analysis with SpaCy. This file can be placed within the `src/modeling` directory of the source code (as per the previously provided file structure) under the name `legal_doc_classifier.py`.

```python
# legal_doc_classifier.py
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score
import joblib

# Load mock data
mock_data = pd.read_csv('data/processed/mock_legal_documents.csv')

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(mock_data['text'], mock_data['label'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the TF-IDF vectorizer
tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000)
X_train_vectorized = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_vectorized = tfidf_vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Initialize and train the classifier (e.g., LinearSVC)
classifier = LinearSVC()
classifier.fit(X_train_vectorized, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test_vectorized)

# Evaluate the classifier
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

# Save the trained classifier to disk
joblib.dump(classifier, 'models/custom_ml_models/legal_doc_classifier.pkl')
```

In this example, the file `legal_doc_classifier.py` showcases the training and evaluation of a complex machine learning algorithm, focusing on a legal document classifier. The mock data is assumed to be stored in a CSV file named `mock_legal_documents.csv` within the `data/processed/` directory.

The script leverages the TF-IDF vectorization technique and a linear support vector machine (LinearSVC) classifier to build a model for classifying legal documents. The trained classifier is then saved to the directory `models/custom_ml_models/` as `legal_doc_classifier.pkl`.

It's important to note that the specific algorithm and data preprocessing steps may differ based on the actual requirements and data characteristics of the AI-Powered Legal Document Analysis application. Furthermore, the complete model development process would typically involve hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and potentially more sophisticated feature engineering or algorithm selection depending on the specific problem domain.

As with any machine learning model, rigorous testing, validation, and documentation are essential components of a comprehensive MLOps pipeline for managing and deploying the trained model effectively.
