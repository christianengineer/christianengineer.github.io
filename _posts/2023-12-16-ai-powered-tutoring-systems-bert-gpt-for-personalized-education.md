Below is a basic Python script for training a mock BERT model for the AI-Powered Tutoring Systems. This script utilizes the PyTorch library for training the BERT model with mock data. Keep in mind that this is a simplified example, and in a real-world scenario, you would use actual training data and may need to modify the script accordingly based on the specifics of the BERT model and training requirements.

**File Path:**
`models/bert/train_bert_model.py`

```python
# train_bert_model.py

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from transformers import BertModel, BertTokenizer
import numpy as np

# Mock training data (replace with actual data loading and preprocessing)
input_texts = ["Sample input text 1", "Another sample input text", "Mock input for training"]
labels = [0, 1, 0]  # Replace with actual labels or targets

# Initializing BERT tokenizer and model
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

# Tokenizing input texts
input_ids = []
attention_masks = []

for text in input_texts:
    encoded_dict = tokenizer.encode_plus(
                        text,
                        add_special_tokens = True,
                        max_length = 64,
                        pad_to_max_length = True,
                        return_attention_mask = True,
                        return_tensors = 'pt'
                   )
    input_ids.append(encoded_dict['input_ids'])
    attention_masks.append(encoded_dict['attention_mask'])

input_ids = torch.cat(input_ids, dim=0)
attention_masks = torch.cat(attention_masks, dim=0)
labels = torch.tensor(labels)

# Define BERT model architecture for fine-tuning
class BertClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, bert_model):
        super(BertClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.bert = bert_model
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.1)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(self.bert.config.hidden_size, 1)

    def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask):
        outputs = self.bert(input_ids, attention_mask)
        pooled_output = outputs.pooler_output
        dropout_output = self.dropout(pooled_output)
        output = self.fc(dropout_output)
        return output

# Create an instance of the BERT classifier model
model = BertClassifier(model)
criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=2e-5)

# Start model training with mock data
epochs = 3  # Number of training epochs
for epoch in range(epochs):
    model.train()
    outputs = model(input_ids, attention_masks)
    loss = criterion(outputs.view(-1), labels.float())
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()

# Save the trained model
output_model_path = 'models/bert/fine-tuned-models/mock_model'
torch.save(model.state_dict(), output_model_path)
```

In this script, we use the `transformers` library from Hugging Face for working with BERT models and PyTorch for training. The training process involves tokenizing the input texts, defining a simple classifier model on top of the BERT model, and conducting a mock training loop for a few epochs. After training, the fine-tuned model is saved to the path specified by `output_model_path`.

This script is a simplified example intended to demonstrate the concept of training a BERT model with mock data. In a real-world scenario, you would use actual training data and potentially leverage distributed training and other optimizations based on the size and complexity of the dataset and model.

Certainly! Below is an example of a script for training a complex machine learning algorithm, specifically a deep learning model using TensorFlow, for the AI-Powered Tutoring Systems. This example utilizes mock data and a simple neural network architecture for illustration purposes.

**File Path:**
`src/model_training/train_complex_ml_model.py`

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import numpy as np

# Mock data generation (replace with actual data loading and preprocessing)
input_data = np.random.rand(100, 10)  # Replace with actual input features
target_data = np.random.randint(2, size=(100, 1))  # Replace with actual target labels

# Define a complex neural network model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    layers.Dropout(0.5),
    layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(input_data, target_data, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Save the trained model
output_model_path = 'models/complex_ml_model.h5'
model.save(output_model_path)
```

In this example, we use TensorFlow to define a complex neural network model with multiple layers. The model is compiled with an optimizer, loss function, and metrics before being trained on the mock input and target data. After training, the model is saved as an HDF5 file at the specified `output_model_path`.

In a real-world scenario, the training data and model architecture would be specific to the requirements of the AI-Powered Tutoring Systems, and may involve advanced deep learning architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers, or other complex models tailored to natural language processing tasks when dealing with BERT or GPT models.

The above code serves as a simplified example to demonstrate the training of a complex machine learning model with mock data. It is important to note that in real-world scenarios, data preprocessing, validation, hyperparameter tuning, and other advanced practices are essential for developing effective models.
