- **Command:** Specifies the command to run the model script (`model_script.py`) when the container starts.

### Performance Optimization Tips:
- Use a slim base image to reduce container size and improve start-up time.
- Utilize multi-stage builds for separating build-time dependencies and runtime environment.
- Minimize the number of layers in the Dockerfile to optimize container performance.
- Ensure efficient resource allocation (CPU and memory limits) while running the container for improved performance.
- Leverage container orchestration tools like Kubernetes for scalability and load balancing.

By following these instructions and optimizing the Dockerfile for performance needs, the container setup will be well-suited for deploying the machine learning model in a production environment for the Renewable Energy Forecasting project.
