Sure, here's an example of a file for training a sentiment analysis model using TensorFlow with mock data:

### File Path: `model/training/train_model.py`

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences

## Mock data (replace with actual dataset)
texts = ["I love the products from this brand!", "This brand is amazing", "Not a fan of their customer service"]
labels = [1, 1, 0]  ## 1 for positive sentiment, 0 for negative sentiment

## Tokenize the text data
tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=1000, oov_token='<OOV>')
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(texts)
word_index = tokenizer.word_index
sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(texts)
padded_sequences = pad_sequences(sequences, maxlen=10)

## Define and compile the model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Embedding(1000, 16, input_length=10),
    keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model with mock data
model.fit(padded_sequences, labels, epochs=10)

## Save the trained model
model.save('sentiment_analysis_model.h5')
```

In this example, the `train_model.py` script demonstrates the process of training a simple sentiment analysis model using mock text data. It tokenizes the text data, defines a basic neural network model, compiles the model, and trains it using the mock data. After training, the model is saved to a file named `sentiment_analysis_model.h5`.

Certainly! Below is an example of a file for a complex machine learning algorithm using TensorFlow for the Automated Sentiment Analysis for Brand Monitoring application with mock data:

### File Path: `model/training/train_complex_model.py`

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

## Mock data (replace with actual dataset)
num_samples = 1000
max_sequence_length = 100

## Generate mock data
X = np.random.randint(1000, size=(num_samples, max_sequence_length))
y = np.random.randint(2, size=num_samples)  ## Binary labels (0 or 1)

## Split the data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Define and compile the complex machine learning model
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Embedding(input_dim=1000, output_dim=100, input_length=max_sequence_length),
    layers.Conv1D(128, 5, activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling1D(5),
    layers.Conv1D(128, 5, activation='relu'),
    layers.GlobalMaxPooling1D(),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model with mock data
model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_val, y_val), epochs=10, batch_size=32)

## Save the trained model
model.save('complex_sentiment_analysis_model.h5')
```

In this example, the `train_complex_model.py` script demonstrates the process of training a complex sentiment analysis model with mock data. It uses a deep learning architecture with convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction and classification. The model is trained and then saved to a file named `complex_sentiment_analysis_model.h5`.
