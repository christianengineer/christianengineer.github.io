I can provide you with a Python script that generates a synthetic dataset with fictitious data for the Peru Fine Dining Table Management System. The dataset will consist of columns representing features relevant to table allocations and reservations optimization. You can run this script to create a CSV file containing the mocked data ready for modeling:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import random
from faker import Faker

# Set random seed for reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)

# Initialize Faker for generating fake data
fake = Faker()

# Generate mocked data for the dataset
data = {
    'reservation_id': [fake.uuid4() for _ in range(1000)],
    'party_size': [random.randint(1, 10) for _ in range(1000)],
    'reservation_date': [fake.date_time_between(start_date='-1y', end_date='+1y') for _ in range(1000)],
    'reservation_time': [fake.time(pattern='%H:%M:%S') for _ in range(1000)],
    'customer_name': [fake.name() for _ in range(1000)],
    'booking_channel': [random.choice(['online', 'phone', 'in-person']) for _ in range(1000)],
    'table_location': [random.choice(['patio', 'main dining area', 'private room']) for _ in range(1000)],
    'reservation_status': [random.choice(['confirmed', 'cancelled', 'no-show']) for _ in range(1000)],
    'waitlist': [random.choice([True, False]) for _ in range(1000)]
}

# Create a DataFrame from the generated data
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Save the generated data to a CSV file
df.to_csv('mocked_dining_data.csv', index=False)
```

Feel free to adjust the number of generated records (`1000` in this case) and the range of values for each feature to match the requirements of your model. After running this script, you will have a CSV file named `mocked_dining_data.csv` containing the fictitious mocked data ready for modeling the Peru Fine Dining Table Management System.

Here is a production-ready Python script that demonstrates the modeling process using the fictitious mocked data generated for the Peru Fine Dining Table Management System. This script includes data preprocessing, model selection (Logistic Regression), training, evaluation, and saving the model for deployment:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
import joblib

# Load the mocked data
data = pd.read_csv('mocked_dining_data.csv')

# Define features and target variable
X = data[['party_size']]
y = data['reservation_status']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Data preprocessing
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Model selection - Logistic Regression
model = LogisticRegression(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Model evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

# Save the trained model to a file
joblib.dump(model, 'dining_table_model.pkl')

# Print model evaluation results
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
print('Classification Report:')
print(report)
```

Run this script after generating the mocked data file. It preprocesses the data, selects a Logistic Regression model, trains and evaluates the model, saves it to a file (`dining_table_model.pkl`), and prints the model evaluation results. You can replace the feature `'party_size'` and the target variable `'reservation_status'` with other relevant features from the generated data. This script provides a foundation for building and deploying machine learning models for the Peru Fine Dining Table Management System.
