In the "models/" directory of the EcoAI AI in Sustainability Analytics application, you would find the following files:

- **trained_model1.h5**: This file contains the trained deep learning model using the Hierarchical Data Format 5 (HDF5) file format. This format is commonly used for saving and loading deep learning models trained using frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras.

- **trained_model2.pkl**: This file contains the trained machine learning model serialized using the pickle module in Python. Pickle is used to serialize and deserialize Python objects, making it a suitable format for saving trained machine learning models along with their associated metadata.

It seems there might have been a slight confusion. In the context of the EcoAI AI in Sustainability Analytics application and the given file structure, the "deployment/" directory is not explicitly mentioned. However, if the application includes deployment-related artifacts, the "deployment/" directory can be organized as follows:

```
EcoAI_AI_Sustainability_Analytics/
│
├── ...
│
└── deployment/
    ├── dockerfile
    ├── kubernetes/
    │   ├── deployment.yaml
    │   ├── service.yaml
    │   └── ...
    └── scripts/
        ├── deploy_script.sh
        └── ...
```

In this structure:

- **dockerfile**: Contains the instructions for building a Docker image that encapsulates the AI analytics and modeling application along with its dependencies.

- **kubernetes/**: Contains Kubernetes deployment manifest files, such as deployment.yaml and service.yaml, for deploying the application as microservices within a Kubernetes cluster.

- **scripts/**: Contains deployment scripts, such as deploy_script.sh, which automate the deployment process (e.g., setting up the environment, starting services, etc.).

These files and directories are essential for orchestrating the deployment of the EcoAI AI in Sustainability Analytics application, enabling efficient and scalable deployment across different environments.

Sure! Below is an example of a function for a complex machine learning algorithm using Python and mock data. This function leverages the Scikit-learn library to create a random forest classifier for predicting sustainability-related outcomes. The function loads mock data from a CSV file and uses it to train and evaluate the model.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def train_random_forest_model(data_file_path):
    ## Load mock data from CSV file
    mock_data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Preprocessing steps (e.g., handling missing values, feature engineering, etc.)
    ## ...

    ## Split data into features and target variable
    X = mock_data.drop('target_column', axis=1)
    y = mock_data['target_column']

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Initialize and train the random forest classifier
    random_forest_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    random_forest_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    ## Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = random_forest_model.predict(X_test)

    ## Evaluate the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy}")

    ## Return the trained model for future use
    return random_forest_model
```

In the above function:
- `data_file_path` represents the file path to the CSV file containing the mock data.
- The function reads the data, performs preprocessing, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a random forest classifier, evaluates the model, and finally returns the trained model for future predictions.

You can integrate this function into the source code within the "src/" directory of the EcoAI AI in Sustainability Analytics application to build and train machine learning models for sustainability analysis.

Certainly! Below is an example of a function for a complex deep learning algorithm using Python and mock data. This function leverages the TensorFlow library to create a deep learning model for predicting sustainability-related outcomes. The function loads mock data from a CSV file, preprocesses it, and uses it to train the deep learning model.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

def train_deep_learning_model(data_file_path):
    ## Load mock data from CSV file
    mock_data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Preprocessing steps (e.g., handling missing values, feature scaling, etc.)
    ## ...

    ## Split data into features and target variable
    X = mock_data.drop('target_column', axis=1)
    y = mock_data['target_column']

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Scale the features
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

    ## Define and train the deep learning model
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test_scaled, y_test))

    ## Evaluate the model
    _, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test_scaled, y_test)
    print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy}")

    ## Return the trained deep learning model for future use
    return model
```

In the above function:
- `data_file_path` represents the file path to the CSV file containing the mock data.
- The function reads the data, performs preprocessing including feature scaling, splits it into training and testing sets, creates and trains a deep learning model, evaluates the model, and finally returns the trained model for future predictions.

You can integrate this function into the source code within the "src/" directory of the EcoAI AI in Sustainability Analytics application to build and train deep learning models for sustainability analysis.
