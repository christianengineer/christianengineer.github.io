# AI Automated Image Captioning with CNN-LSTM

## Objectives
The objective of this project is to build an automated image captioning system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for generating descriptive captions. The system aims to accurately describe images with natural language captions, showcasing the potential of AI in understanding and generating human-like descriptions of visual content.

## System Design Strategies
### Data Collection
- Obtain a large dataset of images with corresponding captions for training the model.
- Preprocess the images to ensure uniformity in size and format.

### Model Architecture
- Utilize a pre-trained CNN such as VGG16 or ResNet for image feature extraction, preserving spatial information.
- Implement an LSTM network to generate captions based on the extracted image features.
- Implement an attention mechanism to focus on different parts of the image while generating captions, enhancing the descriptive accuracy.

### Training and Evaluation
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
- Train the model using the training set and validate it using the validation set to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
- Evaluate the model on the testing set using metrics such as BLEU score to assess the quality of generated captions.

### Deployment
- Integrate the trained model into a web application or API for users to upload images and receive automatically generated captions in real-time.

## Chosen Libraries
- **Python**: Leveraging its rich ecosystem for machine learning and deep learning.
- **TensorFlow or PyTorch**: For building and training the neural network architecture, and for handling the image data pipelines.
- **Keras**: Provides a high-level interface for building neural networks, allowing for rapid prototyping and experimentation.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: For text preprocessing and evaluation of generated captions using linguistic metrics.
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: Used for image preprocessing and manipulation.
- **Flask or FastAPI**: For building the web application or REST API to serve the image captioning model to end-users.

By following these design strategies and utilizing the chosen libraries, the project aims to create an AI system capable of accurately describing images with natural-language captions, demonstrating the power of CNN-LSTM based image captioning.

In the `models/` directory for the Automated Image Captioning with CNN-LSTM application, there are two main files:

1. **cnn_lstm_model.py**: This file contains the implementation of the CNN-LSTM model responsible for automated image captioning. It typically includes the following components:

   - **CNN Feature Extractor**: Implementation of a pre-trained CNN (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) for extracting image features, often using a model like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
   - **LSTM-based Caption Generator**: Implementation of an LSTM network that takes the extracted image features as input and generates descriptive captions for the images.
   - **Attention Mechanism (Optional)**: If an attention mechanism is used to improve the descriptive accuracy of the captions, it would be included in this file.

   Additionally, the `cnn_lstm_model.py` file may define necessary functions for training, inference, and model evaluation, as well as the integration with other components of the system, such as data loading and preprocessing.

2. **evaluation_metrics.py**: This file contains the implementation of evaluation metrics used to quantify the performance of the generated image captions. Common metrics may include:

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python file for training a CNN-LSTM model for the Automated Image Captioning application using mock data. The file path is `model_training.py`:

```python
# model_training.py

import numpy as np
from models.cnn_lstm_model import CNNLSTMModel
from src.data.data_loader import MockDataLoader
from src.utils.config import Config

# Mock data paths
mock_image_data_path = 'data/mock/images/'
mock_caption_data_path = 'data/mock/captions/'

# Load mock data
data_loader = MockDataLoader(mock_image_data_path, mock_caption_data_path)
image_data, caption_data = data_loader.load_data()

# Define model configuration
config = Config()
config.vocab_size = 1000
config.embedding_dim = 256
config.lstm_units = 512
config.image_shape = (224, 224, 3)

# Initialize and train the CNN-LSTM model
cnn_lstm_model = CNNLSTMModel(config)
cnn_lstm_model.build_model()
cnn_lstm_model.train_model(image_data, caption_data, epochs=10, batch_size=64)
cnn_lstm_model.save_model('trained_models/cnn_lstm_model.h5')
```

In this example, the `model_training.py` file demonstrates the following key functionalities:

1. Loading mock image and caption data using a `MockDataLoader` from the `src.data` module.
2. Defining the configuration for the CNN-LSTM model using a `Config` object.
3. Initializing and training the CNN-LSTM model using the `CNNLSTMModel` class, which is responsible for constructing the model architecture and training the model on the mock data.
4. Saving the trained model to the `trained_models/` directory as `cnn_lstm_model.h5`.

This file serves as a mock data-driven training script, enabling the development and testing of the CNN-LSTM model for Automated Image Captioning using placeholder data before integrating with real datasets.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python file implementing a complex machine learning algorithm for the Automated Image Captioning with CNN-LSTM application using mock data. The file path is `complex_ml_algorithm.py`:

```python
# complex_ml_algorithm.py

import numpy as np
from models.cnn_lstm_model import AttentionCNNLSTMModel
from src.data.data_loader import MockDataLoader
from src.utils.config import Config
from src.utils.logger import Logger

def complex_algorithm_main():
    # Mock data paths
    mock_image_data_path = 'data/mock/images/'
    mock_caption_data_path = 'data/mock/captions/'

    # Load mock data
    data_loader = MockDataLoader(mock_image_data_path, mock_caption_data_path)
    image_data, caption_data = data_loader.load_data()

    # Define model configuration
    config = Config()
    config.vocab_size = 10000
    config.embedding_dim = 512
    config.lstm_units = 1024
    config.image_shape = (299, 299, 3)
    
    # Initialize the complex CNN-LSTM model with attention mechanism
    model = AttentionCNNLSTMModel(config)

    # Train the model
    logger = Logger()
    model.build_model()
    model.set_logger(logger)
    history = model.train_model(image_data, caption_data, epochs=20, batch_size=64)

    # Evaluate the model
    evaluation_metrics = model.evaluate_model(image_data, caption_data)
    logger.log("Evaluation Metrics: {}".format(evaluation_metrics))

    # Save the trained model and evaluation logs
    model.save_model('trained_models/complex_cnn_lstm_model.h5')
    logger.save_logs('logs/complex_training_logs.txt')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    complex_algorithm_main()
```

In this example, the `complex_ml_algorithm.py` file demonstrates the following key functionalities:

1. Loading mock image and caption data using a `MockDataLoader` from the `src.data` module.
2. Defining a complex configuration for the CNN-LSTM model with attention mechanism using a `Config` object.
3. Initializing and training the complex CNN-LSTM model with attention using the `AttentionCNNLSTMModel` class, incorporating an attention mechanism for improved caption generation.
4. Logging training progress and evaluation metrics using a `Logger` to track and save logs during model training and evaluation.
5. Saving the trained model to the `trained_models/` directory as `complex_cnn_lstm_model.h5` and logging training metrics to `logs/complex_training_logs.txt`.
