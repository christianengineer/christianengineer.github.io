# AI UrbanPlanner Repository

## Objectives
The AI UrbanPlanner project aims to create an AI application for urban planning that leverages machine learning and deep learning to analyze urban data and make informed decisions. The main objectives of this repository are:
1. Collecting and processing various urban data sources such as population demographics, infrastructure, transportation, and environmental factors.
2. Building machine learning models to predict future urban trends, identify areas for improvement, and optimize resource allocation.
3. Developing a user interface to visualize the analyzed data and model predictions for urban planners and stakeholders.

## System Design Strategies
To achieve these objectives, the following system design strategies are proposed:
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Utilize data pipelines to collect and preprocess urban data from various sources, including public databases, IoT sensors, and satellite imagery.
2. **Machine Learning Model Development**: Implement scalable machine learning and deep learning pipelines to train models for urban trend prediction, anomaly detection, and resource optimization.
3. **Scalable Infrastructure**: Design a scalable and distributed infrastructure to handle large volumes of urban data and model training processes.
4. **User Interface**: Develop an interactive and intuitive user interface for visualizing the analyzed urban data and model predictions.

## Chosen Libraries
The following libraries and frameworks are chosen for implementing the AI UrbanPlanner repository:
1. **Python**: As the primary programming language for its extensive support for data processing, machine learning, and web development.
2. **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: For building and training deep learning models for urban trend prediction and anomaly detection.
3. **Scikit-learn**: For implementing traditional machine learning models such as regression, clustering, and classification.
4. **Apache Spark**: For distributed data processing and model training on large-scale urban datasets.
5. **Flask / Dash**: For developing the user interface, with Flask for backend API development and Dash for interactive data visualization.

By employing these strategies and libraries, the AI UrbanPlanner repository aims to provide a robust platform for urban planners to make data-driven decisions and optimize city planning processes.

## Infrastructure for UrbanPlanner AI

The infrastructure for the UrbanPlanner AI for Urban Planning application encompasses several key components to support scalable data processing, model training, and user interface deployment. The following outlines the infrastructure components and their roles:

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
   - **Data Sources**: Various sources such as public databases, IoT sensors, and satellite imagery provide urban data related to population demographics, infrastructure, transportation, and environmental factors.
   - **Data Pipelines**: Utilize scalable data pipelines, possibly built with Apache Kafka and Apache NiFi, to collect and preprocess the incoming urban data. These pipelines can handle real-time streaming data as well as batch data processing.

### 2. Machine Learning Model Development
   - **Model Training Infrastructure**: Employ scalable infrastructure, possibly on cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud, to handle the computational requirements of training machine learning and deep learning models. This can include the use of distributed computing frameworks such as Apache Spark for large-scale data processing and model training.
   - **ML Model Serving**: Develop a model serving infrastructure, possibly using frameworks like TensorFlow Serving or MLflow, to deploy trained models for making predictions and providing insights.

### 3. User Interface
   - **Web Application**: Host the user interface as a web application using scalable web servers, containers (e.g., Docker), and orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) for managing the application deployment.
   - **Interactive Visualization**: Leverage modern web development frameworks such as React.js for building an interactive and responsive user interface to visualize the analyzed urban data and model predictions.

### 4. Data Storage and Management
   - **Scalable Database**: Utilize scalable and distributed databases like Apache Cassandra or Amazon DynamoDB to store and manage the large volumes of urban data efficiently. This includes historical urban data, processed data, and model outputs.

By carefully designing and implementing the infrastructure components for the UrbanPlanner AI application, we can ensure that it can efficiently handle the processing, analysis, and visualization of urban data while providing the necessary scalability to support the growing needs of urban planning activities.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

def train_urban_trend_prediction_model(data_file_path):
    # Load mock urban data
    urban_data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Preprocess data (mock preprocessing steps)
    X = urban_data.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
    y = urban_data['target_variable']

    # Split data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize and train the model
    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")

    # Return the trained model for deployment
    return model
```

In this function, `train_urban_trend_prediction_model` uses the RandomForestRegressor from the Scikit-learn library to train a model for urban trend prediction. It takes a file path to mock urban data as input, preprocesses the data, trains the model, evaluates its performance, and returns the trained model for deployment.

To use the function, you would provide the file path of the mock urban data file as an argument:
```python
data_path = 'path_to_mock_urban_data.csv'
trained_model = train_urban_trend_prediction_model(data_path)
```
This function serves as a simple example of training a machine learning model with mock data for the UrbanPlanner AI application. Actual implementation would involve more comprehensive data processing, feature engineering, and model evaluation steps.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

def train_urban_trend_prediction_deep_learning_model(data_file_path):
    # Load mock urban data
    urban_data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Preprocess data (mock preprocessing steps)
    X = urban_data.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
    y = urban_data['target_variable']
    
    # Scale the input features
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

    # Split data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Build the deep learning model
    model = Sequential([
        Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X.shape[1],)),
        Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        Dense(1)
    ])

    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    # Evaluate the model
    _, mse = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
    print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")

    # Return the trained deep learning model for deployment
    return model
```

In this function, `train_urban_trend_prediction_deep_learning_model` uses the Keras API with TensorFlow backend to construct and train a deep learning model for urban trend prediction. The function takes a file path to mock urban data as input, preprocesses the data, trains the deep learning model, evaluates its performance, and returns the trained model for deployment.

To use the function, you would provide the file path of the mock urban data file as an argument:
```python
data_path = 'path_to_mock_urban_data.csv'
trained_deep_learning_model = train_urban_trend_prediction_deep_learning_model(data_path)
```
This function provides a basic outline for training a deep learning model with mock data for the UrbanPlanner AI application. Further customization, tuning, and optimization would be required for real-world use cases, including more complex network architectures and hyperparameter tuning.
