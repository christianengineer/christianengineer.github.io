Sure, here's an example of a function for a complex machine learning algorithm in Python using TensorFlow/Keras for the Facial Emotion Recognition System. This function assumes the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for emotion recognition. Additionally, I'll include code to preprocess the mock data by loading and resizing the images. For the purpose of this example, I'll use placeholder code for the algorithm and mock data generation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

def train_emotion_detection_model(data_directory):
    ## Define the CNN model architecture
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(48, 48, 1)))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
    model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
    model.add(Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
    model.add(Flatten())
    model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dense(7, activation='softmax'))  ## Assuming 7 emotions for classification

    ## Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    ## Load and preprocess mock data
    ## Replace this with actual data loading and preprocessing logic
    mock_data = load_and_preprocess_mock_data(data_directory)

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(mock_data, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

    ## Save the trained model to a file
    model.save('emotion_detection_model.h5')

def load_and_preprocess_mock_data(data_directory):
    ## Replace this with actual data loading and preprocessing logic
    ## Example: Load images, resize to 48x48, and convert to grayscale
    mock_data = [...]  ## Placeholder for loading and preprocessing mock data
    return mock_data
```

In this example:

- The `train_emotion_detection_model` function defines a complex CNN model architecture using TensorFlow/Keras for training the emotion detection model.
- Within the function, placeholder logic for loading and preprocessing mock data from the specified `data_directory` is included.
- The model is then trained using the mock data and saved to a file (`emotion_detection_model.h5`).

When using this function, replace the placeholder code for data loading and preprocessing with the actual logic to load and preprocess the facial expression data. The `data_directory` argument should contain the file path to the directory where the mock data is stored.

This function demonstrates the training of a complex machine learning algorithm for the Facial Emotion Recognition System using TensorFlow/Keras and the processing of mock data to train the emotion detection model.

Certainly! Below is an example of a function for a complex deep learning algorithm, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented using TensorFlow/Keras for the Facial Emotion Recognition System. This function assumes the use of a CNN for emotion recognition and includes code to preprocess the mock data by loading and resizing the images.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

def train_emotion_detection_model(data_directory):
    ## Define the CNN model architecture
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(48, 48, 1)))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
    model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
    model.add(Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
    model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
    model.add(Flatten())
    model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dense(7, activation='softmax'))  ## Assuming 7 emotions for classification

    ## Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    ## Load and preprocess mock data
    mock_data = load_and_preprocess_mock_data(data_directory)

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(mock_data, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

    ## Save the trained model to a file
    model.save('emotion_detection_model.h5')

def load_and_preprocess_mock_data(data_directory):
    ## Placeholder for loading and preprocessing mock data
    ## Replace this with actual data loading and preprocessing logic
    mock_data = [...]  ## Placeholder for loading and preprocessing mock data
    return mock_data
```

In this example:

- The `train_emotion_detection_model` function defines a CNN model architecture using TensorFlow/Keras for training the emotion detection model.
- The model is compiled using categorical cross-entropy as the loss function and accuracy as the evaluation metric.
- The `load_and_preprocess_mock_data` function is a placeholder for loading and preprocessing mock data from the specified `data_directory`. Replace the placeholder logic with the actual data loading and preprocessing code.
- The model is trained using the mock data and saved to a file (`emotion_detection_model.h5`).

When using this function, replace the placeholder code for data loading and preprocessing with the actual logic to load and preprocess the facial expression data. The `data_directory` argument should contain the file path to the directory where the mock data is stored.

This function serves as a blueprint for training a complex deep learning algorithm, allowing the Facial Emotion Recognition System to recognize emotions from facial expressions using deep learning techniques.
