Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a model for the Air Quality Prediction using Keras and TensorFlow, utilizing mock data. The script demonstrates how to define a simple neural network architecture, compile the model, train it on mock data, and save the trained model artifacts to the specified file path.

```python
# File: model_training.py
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Mock data generation (replace with actual data loading and preprocessing)
X = np.random.rand(1000, 10)  # Example features
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)  # Example labels (binary classification)

# Splitting the mock data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define a simple neural network architecture using Keras
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model on the mock data
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))

# Serialize the model architecture and weights to the specified file path
model.save('trained_models/mock_model.h5')
```

In this example, the training script `model_training.py` utilizes randomly generated mock data for demonstration purposes. The trained model artifacts (architecture and weights) are serialized and saved to the `trained_models/` directory within the repository.

The file path for the trained model artifacts is:
```
trained_models/mock_model.h5
```

Please note that in a real-world scenario, actual air quality data and appropriate preprocessing should be used for training the model. Additionally, the model architecture, hyperparameters, and training process should be tailored to the specific requirements and characteristics of the air quality prediction task.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a complex machine learning algorithm for the Air Quality Prediction using Keras and TensorFlow, utilizing mock data. The script demonstrates how to define a more intricate neural network architecture, compile the model, train it on mock data, and save the trained model artifacts to the specified file path.

```python
# File: complex_model_training.py
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Mock data generation (replace with actual data loading and preprocessing)
# Example of using image data (dimensions: 1000 samples, 32x32 size, 3 channels for RGB)
X = np.random.rand(1000, 32, 32, 3)  # Example features
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)  # Example labels (binary classification)

# Splitting the mock data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define a complex neural network architecture using Keras
model = keras.Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model on the mock data
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))

# Serialize the model architecture and weights to the specified file path
model.save('trained_models/complex_mock_model.h5')
```

In this example, the script `complex_model_training.py` utilizes randomly generated mock image data for demonstration purposes. The trained model artifacts (architecture and weights) are serialized and saved to the `trained_models/` directory within the repository.

The file path for the trained model artifacts is:
```
trained_models/complex_mock_model.h5
```

In a real-world scenario, actual air quality data and appropriate preprocessing would be used for training the model. Additionally, the model architecture, hyperparameters, and training process should be tailored to the specific requirements and characteristics of the air quality prediction task.
