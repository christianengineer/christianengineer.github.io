# AI Churn Prediction using LightGBM

## Objectives
The objective of the AI churn prediction system is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict customer attrition or churn. By utilizing historical customer data, the system aims to identify patterns and factors associated with customers who are likely to churn. This will enable businesses to proactively take measures to retain at-risk customers and minimize revenue loss.

## System Design Strategies
- **Data Collection**: Gather relevant customer data such as demographics, transaction history, customer interactions, and usage patterns.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract and create meaningful features from the data that can improve the predictive performance of the model.
- **Model Training**: Utilize LightGBM, a gradient boosting framework, to train a machine learning model on the preprocessed data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the model by tuning the hyperparameters of the LightGBM algorithm to improve its predictive accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess its performance.
- **Deployment**: Integrate the trained model into a scalable and production-ready system that can make real-time predictions on customer churn.

## Chosen Libraries
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing tasks.
- **Scikit-learn**: To split the dataset, perform feature engineering, and evaluate the model.
- **LightGBM**: As the primary machine learning framework for training the churn prediction model using gradient boosting algorithms.
- **Flask**: For building a RESTful API to serve the trained model for making real-time predictions.
- **Docker**: To containerize the application and ensure portability and scalability.

By following these design strategies and leveraging the chosen libraries, the system can effectively predict customer churn using LightGBM while maintaining scalability, data integrity, and real-time predictability.

# Infrastructure for Churn Prediction using LightGBM

To build a scalable infrastructure for the Churn Prediction using LightGBM application, we can leverage modern cloud-based technologies and principles of microservices architecture.

## Cloud Infrastructure
Utilize a cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud to host the application. The cloud infrastructure provides scalability, reliability, and security.

## Microservices Architecture
Implement a microservices architecture to break down the application into smaller, independent services. This allows for better maintainability, scalability, and flexibility in deploying and updating individual components.

## Components of the Infrastructure
1. **Data Storage**: Utilize a scalable and reliable data storage solution such as Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage to store the customer data used for training and inference.

2. **Model Training**: Set up a scalable model training infrastructure using cloud-based compute resources such as AWS EC2 instances, Azure Virtual Machines, or Google Compute Engine. Use containerization technologies like Docker to encapsulate the model training process and ensure reproducibility.

3. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained LightGBM churn prediction model as a microservice using a container orchestration system like Kubernetes, or a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda or Azure Functions. This allows for automatic scaling based on demand and high availability.

4. **API Gateway**: Use a cloud-based API gateway service such as AWS API Gateway or Azure API Management to manage and secure the APIs for real-time predictions.

5. **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement a monitoring and logging solution using tools like AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, or Google Cloud Operations to monitor the performance, health, and security of the application.

## Automation and Infrastructure as Code
Leverage infrastructure as code tools like AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager, or Google Cloud Deployment Manager to define the infrastructure and automate the provisioning, configuration, and management of cloud resources.

By adopting cloud infrastructure, microservices architecture, and the above components, the Churn Prediction using LightGBM application can be built to be scalable, reliable, and cost-effective, while leveraging the predictive capabilities of the AI model.

Certainly! Below is a Python function for a complex machine learning algorithm for churn prediction using LightGBM, which includes the training of the model on mock data and saving the trained model to a file path.

```python
import pandas as pd
import lightgbm as lgb
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def train_lightgbm_churn_prediction_model(data_path, model_save_path):
    # Load mock data
    mock_data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

    # Preprocess the data (example: handle missing values, feature encoding, etc.)
    # ...

    # Split the data into features and target variable
    X = mock_data.drop('churn_label', axis=1)
    y = mock_data['churn_label']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Define the LightGBM model
    lgb_model = lgb.LGBMClassifier(num_leaves=31, learning_rate=0.05, n_estimators=100)

    # Train the model
    lgb_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = lgb_model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    # Save the trained model to a file path
    lgb_model.booster_.save_model(model_save_path)

    return accuracy, model_save_path

# Example usage
data_path = 'data/processed_data/train.csv'
model_save_path = 'models/trained_model/lightgbm_model.pkl'
accuracy, saved_model_path = train_lightgbm_churn_prediction_model(data_path, model_save_path)
print(f"Model trained with accuracy: {accuracy}. Saved at: {saved_model_path}")
```

In the provided `train_lightgbm_churn_prediction_model` function, the `data_path` parameter specifies the file path where the mock data is located, and the `model_save_path` parameter specifies the file path where the trained LightGBM model will be saved.

This function loads the mock data, preprocesses it, trains a LightGBM classification model, evaluates its accuracy, and saves the trained model to the specified file path. The function returns the accuracy of the trained model and the file path where the model is saved.

This function provides a starting point for training a complex machine learning algorithm for churn prediction using LightGBM with mock data, and the file paths can be adjusted to match the actual data and model storage locations in the application.

```python
import pandas as pd
import lightgbm as lgb
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def train_lightgbm_churn_prediction_model(data_path, model_save_path):
    # Load mock data
    mock_data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

    # Preprocess the data (example: handle missing values, feature encoding, etc.)
    # ...

    # Split the data into features and target variable
    X = mock_data.drop('churn_label', axis=1)
    y = mock_data['churn_label']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Define the LightGBM model
    lgb_model = lgb.LGBMClassifier(num_leaves=31, learning_rate=0.05, n_estimators=100)

    # Train the model
    lgb_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = lgb_model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    # Save the trained model to a file path
    lgb_model.booster_.save_model(model_save_path)

    return accuracy, model_save_path

# Example usage
data_path = 'data/processed_data/train.csv'
model_save_path = 'models/trained_model/lightgbm_model.txt'
accuracy, saved_model_path = train_lightgbm_churn_prediction_model(data_path, model_save_path)
print(f"Model trained with accuracy: {accuracy}. Saved at: {saved_model_path}")
