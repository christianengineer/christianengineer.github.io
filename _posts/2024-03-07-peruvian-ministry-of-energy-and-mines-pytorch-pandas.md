## Data Preprocessing for Robust Machine Learning Models

In the context of our energy demand forecasting project for the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines, several specific data-related challenges may arise that could impact the performance and reliability of our machine learning models. To address these challenges effectively, strategic data preprocessing practices can be employed to mitigate issues and ensure the data remains robust and conducive to high-performing models. Here are insights directly relevant to the unique demands and characteristics of our project:

## Specific Problems with Data and Solutions through Data Preprocessing

### 1. Missing Values in Energy Consumption Data
- **Problem**: Historical energy consumption data may contain missing values due to measurement errors or other factors, potentially leading to biased model predictions.
- **Solution**: Impute missing values using appropriate techniques such as mean, median imputation, forward/backward filling, or interpolation to fill gaps in the data while preserving the temporal structure.

### 2. Seasonal Trends and Outliers in Energy Consumption Patterns
- **Problem**: Seasonal variations or outliers in energy consumption patterns can distort the model's understanding of underlying trends, affecting forecast accuracy.
- **Solution**: Apply robust statistical methods to detect and handle outliers, such as Z-score, IQR, or clustering-based outlier detection. Use seasonal decomposition techniques (e.g., seasonal decomposition of time series) to isolate trends, seasonality, and residual components for better modeling.

### 3. Integration of Weather Data with Energy Consumption Data
- **Problem**: Weather data may exhibit noise or discrepancies that could introduce spurious correlations with energy consumption, impacting the model's generalization performance.
- **Solution**: Cleanse and preprocess weather data by smoothing noisy signals, handling missing values, and aligning timestamps with energy consumption records. Consider feature engineering techniques to extract relevant weather features that capture meaningful relationships with energy demand.

### 4. Temporal Misalignment Between Different Data Sources
- **Problem**: Data from diverse sources, such as energy consumption records, weather data, and holiday schedules, may have temporal misalignments that complicate feature integration and model training.
- **Solution**: Align timestamps across different datasets through interpolation, resampling, or merging techniques to ensure temporal consistency. Create synchronized time series datasets for seamless integration into the forecasting model.

### 5. Data Scaling and Normalization for LSTM Model Input
- **Problem**: LSTM models are sensitive to the scale of input features, and unnormalized data may lead to gradient explosions or vanishing gradients during training.
- **Solution**: Scale numerical features using Min-Max scaling, Standard scaling, or other normalization techniques to ensure all input features fall within a similar range. Normalize time series data to enhance model convergence and stability during training.

By strategically employing data preprocessing practices tailored to address these specific challenges in our energy demand forecasting project, we can ensure that the data remains robust, reliable, and conducive to building high-performing machine learning models. Handling these data-related issues effectively will enhance the accuracy and efficiency of our forecasting system, supporting informed decision-making for energy production and distribution planning by the Ministry of Energy and Mines.

## Load the energy consumption data
energy_data = pd.read_csv('energy_consumption_data.csv')

## Convert the date/time column to datetime format
energy_data['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(energy_data['timestamp'])

## Sort the data by timestamp to ensure chronological order
energy_data = energy_data.sort_values('timestamp')

## Impute missing values in energy consumption column with forward fill
energy_data['energy_consumption'].fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)

## Feature Engineering: Extract date and time features
energy_data['day_of_week'] = energy_data['timestamp'].dt.dayofweek
energy_data['month'] = energy_data['timestamp'].dt.month
energy_data['hour'] = energy_data['timestamp'].dt.hour

## Feature Scaling: Normalize energy consumption data
