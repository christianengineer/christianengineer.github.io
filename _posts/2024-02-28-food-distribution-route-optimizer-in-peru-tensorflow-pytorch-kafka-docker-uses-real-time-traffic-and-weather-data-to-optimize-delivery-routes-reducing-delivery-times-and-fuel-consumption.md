I'll provide a Python script for training a TensorFlow model using mock data for the Food Distribution Route Optimizer application. This script assumes the use of TensorFlow for building and training the model. This script can be saved in the following file path within the project structure:

**File Path:** `src/model_development/train_model_tensorflow.py`

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Mock data for training
traffic_data = np.random.rand(100, 3)  # Mock traffic data with 3 features
weather_data = np.random.rand(100, 2)  # Mock weather data with 2 features
labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=100)  # Mock labels for route optimization

# Define the TensorFlow model architecture
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(x=[traffic_data, weather_data], y=labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Save the trained model
model.save('models/tensorflow_models/trained_model')
```

In this script:
- Mock data for traffic and weather is generated for training the model.
- A simple neural network model is defined using TensorFlow's Keras API.
- The model is compiled with Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.
- The model is trained with the mock data for 10 epochs.
- The trained model is saved in the `models/tensorflow_models` directory.

This script can be executed to train a TensorFlow model using mock data for the Food Distribution Route Optimizer application.

I'll provide a Python script for implementing a complex machine learning algorithm using PyTorch for the Food Distribution Route Optimizer application. This script will incorporate a more advanced model architecture and training process. The script can be saved in the following file path within the project structure:

**File Path:** `src/model_development/train_model_pytorch.py`

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np

# Mock data for training
traffic_data = torch.tensor(np.random.rand(100, 3), dtype=torch.float)  # Mock traffic data with 3 features
weather_data = torch.tensor(np.random.rand(100, 2), dtype=torch.float)  # Mock weather data with 2 features
labels = torch.randint(0, 2, (100,), dtype=torch.float)  # Mock labels for route optimization

# Define a complex neural network model using PyTorch
class ComplexModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ComplexModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(5, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, 1)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = torch.sigmoid(self.fc3(x))
        return x

model = ComplexModel()

# Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.BCELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Train the model
for epoch in range(10):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(torch.cat((traffic_data, weather_data), dim=1))
    loss = criterion(outputs.squeeze(), labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Save the trained model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'models/pytorch_models/trained_model.pth')
```

In this script:
- Mock data for traffic and weather is generated for training the PyTorch model.
- A complex neural network model is defined with multiple layers using PyTorch's neural network module.
- Binary Cross Entropy loss function and Adam optimizer are used for training.
- The model is trained for 10 epochs with the mock data.
- The trained model's state_dict is saved in the `models/pytorch_models` directory.

This script can be executed to train a PyTorch model using mock data for the Food Distribution Route Optimizer application, leveraging a more complex machine learning algorithm.
