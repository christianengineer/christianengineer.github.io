```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from joblib import dump

def complex_machine_learning_algorithm(data_file_path, model_output_path):
    # Load the mock data
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Preprocessing
    X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = data['target']
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Complex machine learning algorithm (Random Forest as an example)
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=3, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Evaluate the model
    accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
    print(f'Model accuracy: {accuracy}')

    # Save the trained model to the specified output path
    dump(model, model_output_path)
```
In this function, the `complex_machine_learning_algorithm` takes two parameters:
1. `data_file_path`: The file path of the mock data that contains the features and the target variable for the machine learning model.
2. `model_output_path`: The file path where the trained machine learning model will be saved.

This function loads the mock data from the specified file path, preprocesses it, trains a complex machine learning algorithm using a RandomForestClassifier as an example, evaluates the model's accuracy, and then saves the trained model to the specified output path using joblib's `dump` function.

You can call this function by providing the file paths for the mock data and the desired location to save the trained model. Keep in mind that this is a simplified example, and in a real-world scenario, the function and the machine learning algorithm would be more complex and tailored to the specific problem domain.

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

def complex_deep_learning_algorithm(data_file_path, model_output_path):
    # Load the mock data
    data = np.load(data_file_path)
    X = data['features']
    y = data['target']

    # Preprocessing
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Deep learning architecture
    model = models.Sequential()
    model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)))
    model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))
    model.add(layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='binary_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    # Evaluate the model
    _, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
    print(f'Model accuracy: {accuracy}')

    # Save the trained model to the specified output path
    model.save(model_output_path)
```
In this function, the `complex_deep_learning_algorithm` takes two parameters:
