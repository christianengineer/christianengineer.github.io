imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
data['budget'] = imputer.fit_transform(data[['budget']])
data['duration'].fillna(data['duration'].mode()[0], inplace=True)

# Step 2: Normalize Numerical Features
scaler = StandardScaler()
data['budget'] = scaler.fit_transform(data[['budget']])
data['duration'] = scaler.fit_transform(data[['duration']])

# Step 3: Text Preprocessing for Abstract Information
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

def preprocess_text(text):
    tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())
    tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(token) for token in tokens if token.isalnum() and token not in stop_words]
