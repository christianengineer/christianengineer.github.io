Certainly! Here's a Python function that applies a complex machine learning algorithm to train a recommendation model using mock data. Note that this code assumes the existence of mock data files in CSV format, which are stored in the `data/raw/` directory within the RecoEngine repository. The function uses the `pandas` library for data manipulation and a hypothetical machine learning algorithm for model training.

```python
import pandas as pd

def train_recommendation_model(data_path):
    # Load mock data from CSV file
    data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

    # Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering
    # ...

    # Split the data into training and validation sets
    # ...

    # Apply a complex machine learning algorithm for training the recommendation model
    # Replace this with the actual machine learning algorithm (e.g., neural collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, etc.)
    trained_model = complex_machine_learning_algorithm.fit(training_features, training_labels)

    return trained_model
```

In this example, the `train_recommendation_model` function takes the path to the mock data file as input and follows the steps of loading the data, preprocessing, feature engineering, splitting the data, and applying a complex machine learning algorithm to train the recommendation model. The trained model is then returned as the output of the function.

The mock data file path could be something like `"data/raw/mock_recommendation_data.csv"`, assuming that the mock data file is stored in the `data/raw/` directory of the RecoEngine repository.

Please note that the placeholder comments (`# ...`) denote the steps that would be specific to the actual data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the machine learning algorithm used for the recommendation model. Additionally, the specific machine learning algorithm used would depend on the requirements and nature of the recommendation system being developed.

Let me know if you need further details or modifications to the function based on specific requirements or the actual machine learning algorithm to be used!

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python function that utilizes a deep learning algorithm to train a recommendation model using mock data. This function assumes that the mock data is stored in CSV format in the `data/raw/` directory within the RecoEngine repository. The function employs the `TensorFlow` framework for building and training the deep learning model.

```python
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def train_deep_learning_recommendation_model(data_path):
    # Load mock data from CSV file
    data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

    # Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering
    # ...

    # Split the data into features and labels
    features = data[feature_columns]
    labels = data[label_column]

    # Split the data into training and validation sets
    train_features, val_features, train_labels, val_labels = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Define and train the deep learning recommendation model
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        # Define the layers and architecture of the deep learning model
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_shape,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    # Train the model
    model.fit(train_features, train_labels, epochs=10, batch_size=64, validation_data=(val_features, val_labels))

    return model
```

In this example, the `train_deep_learning_recommendation_model` function takes the path to the mock data file as input and proceeds with loading the data, performing data preprocessing, feature engineering, splitting the data into features and labels, and building a deep learning recommendation model using TensorFlow. The trained model is then returned as the output of the function.

The mock data file path could be something like `"data/raw/mock_recommendation_data.csv"`, considering that the mock data file is stored in the `data/raw/` directory of the RecoEngine repository.

Please note that the code provided is a simplified example, and the specific architecture and parameters of the deep learning model would depend on the nature of the recommendation system and the characteristics of the data.

Feel free to let me know if you need further details or modifications based on specific requirements or the actual deep learning algorithm to be utilized!
