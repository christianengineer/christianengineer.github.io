This structure supports automation, standardization, and reproducibility in deploying and managing the AI-enhanced CRM application across different environments and cloud providers.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a machine learning model with mock data for the AI-enhanced Customer Relationship Management application. This script uses scikit-learn to train a simple classifier as an illustrative example.

File path: `models/training/train_model.py`

```python
# train_model.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Load mock data (replace with actual data loading code)
def load_mock_data():
    data = {
        'feature1': [1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5],
        'feature2': [0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5],
        'label': [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
    }
    return pd.DataFrame(data)

# Preprocess the data
def preprocess_data(data):
    X = data[['feature1', 'feature2']]
    y = data['label']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Standardize the features
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

    return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test

# Train a machine learning model
def train_model(X_train, y_train):
    model = SVC(kernel='linear', random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    return model

# Evaluate the trained model
def evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test):
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
    print("Model Evaluation Report:")
    print(report)
    print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

def main():
    # Load mock data
    data = load_mock_data()

    # Preprocess the data
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = preprocess_data(data)

    # Train the model
    model = train_model(X_train, y_train)

    # Evaluate the model
    evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

    scaler = StandardScaler()  # Standardizing features
    X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

    return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test


# Define a complex neural network model
def build_model(input_dim):
    model = Sequential([
        Dense(64, input_dim=input_dim, activation='relu'),
        Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Binary classification output
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model


def train_and_evaluate_model(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test):
    input_dim = X_train.shape[1]
    model = build_model(input_dim)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    y_pred = (model.predict(X_test) > 0.5).astype("int32")  # Predicting on test data
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
    print("Model Evaluation Report:")
    print(report)
    print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")


def main():
    X, y = load_mock_data()

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = preprocess_data(X, y)

    train_and_evaluate_model(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
