Certainly! Below is a sample file for training a PyTorch model in the "Accessible Web Content Tools" application using mock data. This file can be placed within the `models` directory as `train_model.py`.

```python
## models/train_model.py

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torchvision import datasets, transforms
from models.model import MyModel  ## Import your PyTorch model implementation

## Define mock data loaders (replace with actual data loaders)
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.5,), (0.5,))
])

mock_train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
    datasets.FakeData(transform=transform),  ## Replace with actual training data
    batch_size=64, shuffle=True
)

mock_test_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
    datasets.FakeData(transform=transform),  ## Replace with actual test data
    batch_size=1000, shuffle=True
)

## Define the PyTorch model and optimizer
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model = MyModel()  ## Instantiate your PyTorch model
model.to(device)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)

## Train the model using mock data
def train_model():
    model.train()
    for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(mock_train_loader):
        data, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data)
        loss = criterion(output, target)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

## Evaluate the model using mock test data
def evaluate_model():
    model.eval()
    test_loss = 0
    correct = 0
    with torch.no_grad():
        for data, target in mock_test_loader:
            data, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)
            output = model(data)
            test_loss += criterion(output, target).item()
            pred = output.argmax(dim=1, keepdim=True)
            correct += pred.eq(target.view_as(pred)).sum().item()
    test_loss /= len(mock_test_loader.dataset)
    accuracy = 100. * correct / len(mock_test_loader.dataset)
    print(f'Average loss: {test_loss}, Accuracy: {accuracy}%')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    for epoch in range(1, 11):  ## Replace with actual training loop
        train_model()
        print(f"Epoch {epoch} completed.")
        evaluate_model()
    torch.save(model.state_dict(), "trained_models/mock_model.pth")  ## Save the trained model
```

In this sample file (`models/train_model.py`), we import the necessary libraries, define mock data loaders, define a PyTorch model, train the model using mock data, and then evaluate the model's performance. The trained model is then saved to a file (`trained_models/mock_model.pth`).

This file structure and content assume that you have a PyTorch model implementation (`models/model.py`) and accompanying data loaders for your specific AI-driven accessibility task. The provided code is designed to be a starting point and should be tailored to your actual data and model requirements.

Certainly! Below is a sample file for a complex machine learning algorithm in the "Accessible Web Content Tools" application using PyTorch and mock data. This file can be placed within the `models` directory as `complex_algorithm.py`.

```python

    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.5,), (0.5,))
])

mock_train_loader = DataLoader(
    datasets.FakeData(transform=transform),  ## Replace with actual training data
    batch_size=64, shuffle=True
)

    datasets.FakeData(transform=transform),  ## Replace with actual test data
    batch_size=1000, shuffle=True
)

## Define the complex model and optimizer
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model = ComplexModel()  ## Instantiate the complex PyTorch model
model.to(device)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

## Train and evaluate the complex model using mock data
def train_and_evaluate_complex_model():
    model.train()
    for epoch in range(10):  ## Replace with actual training loop
        running_loss = 0.0
        for i, data in enumerate(mock_train_loader, 0):
            inputs, labels = data[0].to(device), torch.randint(0, 2, (64,)).to(device)  ## Replace with actual data
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            outputs = model(inputs)
            loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            running_loss += loss.item()

        print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1}, Loss: {running_loss / len(mock_train_loader)}")

    model.eval()
    correct = 0
    total = 0
    with torch.no_grad():
        for data in mock_test_loader:
            inputs, labels = data[0].to(device), torch.randint(0, 2, (1000,)).to(device)  ## Replace with actual data
            outputs = model(inputs)
            _, predicted = torch.max(outputs, 1)
            total += labels.size(0)
            correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()

    print(f"Accuracy on test data: {100 * correct / total}%")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    train_and_evaluate_complex_model()
    torch.save(model.state_dict(), "trained_models/complex_model.pth")  ## Save the trained complex model
```

In this sample file (`models/complex_algorithm.py`), we define a complex PyTorch model, instantiate mock data loaders, train the model using the mock data, and then evaluate the model's performance. The trained complex model is then saved to a file (`trained_models/complex_model.pth`).

This file structure and content assume that you have a complex PyTorch model implementation (`models/ComplexModel`) and accompanying data loaders for your specific AI-driven accessibility task. The provided code is designed to be a starting point and should be tailored to your actual data and model requirements.
