In the "utils" directory of the ManufactureAI repository, various subdirectories and files contain utility scripts for common functionalities and operations that are shared across different components of the AI application. These utilities aid in promoting code reusability, maintainability, and abstraction of common operations. Below is a breakdown of the contents of the "utils" directory:

Sure, here's an example of a function for a complex machine learning algorithm using mock data in Python. In this example, let's consider a fictional algorithm for predictive maintenance in a manufacturing plant. This function uses the scikit-learn library to build a machine learning model for predicting equipment failures based on sensor data.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
import joblib

def train_predictive_maintenance_model(data_file_path):
    ## Load mock sensor data from a CSV file
    sensor_data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Preprocessing and feature engineering steps
    ## ...

    ## Split the data into features and target variable
    X = sensor_data.drop('failure', axis=1)
    y = sensor_data['failure']

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Initialize the Random Forest classifier
    clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

    ## Train the classifier
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    ## Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

    ## Evaluate the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
    confusion_mat = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

    ## Save the trained model to a file
    model_file_path = 'trained_predictive_maintenance_model.pkl'
    joblib.dump(clf, model_file_path)

    return accuracy, report, confusion_mat, model_file_path
```

In this function:

- We load the mock sensor data from a CSV file using pandas.
- We preprocess the data, including feature engineering steps (which are omitted for brevity).
- We split the data into training and testing sets.
- We initialize a RandomForestClassifier and train the classifier on the training data.
- We make predictions on the test set and evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
- Finally, we save the trained model to a file using joblib.

The function takes the file path of the mock sensor data as input and returns the accuracy of the model, the classification report, the confusion matrix, and the file path where the trained model is saved.

Note: Replace the preprocessing and feature engineering steps with actual data preprocessing and feature engineering for the specific machine learning algorithm and domain in the ManufactureAI application.

Certainly! Below is an example of a function for a complex deep learning algorithm using mock data. In this case, we'll create a function for a deep learning model to perform image classification for quality control in manufacturing using TensorFlow/Keras.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
import joblib

def train_quality_control_deep_learning_model(image_data_file_path, labels_file_path):
    ## Load mock image data and labels
    image_data = np.load(image_data_file_path)
    labels = pd.read_csv(labels_file_path)

    ## Preprocessing and normalization
    ## ...

    ## Encode labels to numerical values
    label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
    encoded_labels = label_encoder.fit_transform(labels)

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(image_data, encoded_labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Build a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
        tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])

    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    ## Save the trained model to a file
    model_file_path = 'trained_quality_control_model.h5'
    model.save(model_file_path)

    return model_file_path
```

In this function:

- We load mock image data and their corresponding labels.
- We preprocess the image data, including normalization and encoding of labels as numerical values.
- We split the data into training and testing sets.
- We build a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras for image classification.
- We train the model on the training data.
- Finally, we save the trained model to a file.

The function takes the file path of the mock image data and the file path of the labels as input and returns the file path where the trained deep learning model is saved.

Note: The architecture of the deep learning model is a simplified example. In practice, the architecture and hyperparameters would be tailored to the specific requirements of the quality control task in the ManufactureAI application. Additionally, actual image preprocessing steps and label encoding would need to be implemented based on the specific image data and label formats.
