## Project Objectives

The main objective of the AI Peru Vocational Training project is to match individuals with vocational training opportunities based on their skills, interests, and local market needs in order to promote economic upliftment. This will be achieved by utilizing AI technologies to analyze data on skills, interests, and market demands to provide personalized recommendations for training courses or job opportunities tailored to each individual.

## System Design Strategies

1. **Data Collection**: Gather data on individual skills and interests, as well as information on vocational training programs and local market needs.
2. **Data Processing**: Preprocess and clean the data to prepare it for analysis and model training.
3. **Machine Learning Models**: Develop machine learning models using TensorFlow and Keras to analyze the data and generate recommendations based on individual profiles and market demands.
4. **User Interface**: Build a user interface using Django to allow users to input their information and view personalized recommendations.
5. **Scalability**: Design the system to handle a large number of users and data points by leveraging containerization with Docker for efficient deployment and scaling.
6. **Performance Optimization**: Implement strategies to optimize the performance of the machine learning models and data processing pipelines for real-time recommendations.
7. **Feedback Loop**: Incorporate a feedback loop mechanism to continuously improve the recommendations based on user feedback and outcomes of the recommended training programs.

## Chosen Libraries

1. **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow will be used for developing and training the machine learning models for analyzing skills, interests, and market demand data.
2. **Keras**: Keras, as a high-level API built on top of TensorFlow, will simplify the design and training of neural networks for the recommendation system.
3. **Django**: Django will be used for building the web application and user interface, enabling users to interact with the system and receive personalized recommendations.
4. **Docker**: Docker will be used for containerizing the application, allowing for easy deployment and scaling of the system to handle varying user loads and data volumes.

```python
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

## Generate mock data for training
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)  ## Mock features data
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)  ## Mock target data

## Define a simple neural network model using Keras
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)))
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model using mock data
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

## Save the trained model
model.save('../saved_models/vocational_training_model.h5')
```

### Explanation:

- This Python script generates mock data for training by creating random features and target arrays.
- A simple neural network model is defined using Keras with input layer, hidden layers, and output layer.
- The model is compiled with Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss for binary classification.
- The model is trained on the generated mock data for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32.
- Finally, the trained model is saved in the `/saved_models` directory as `vocational_training_model.h5`.

This script demonstrates a basic model training workflow using mock data for the Peru Vocational Training AI application. The trained model file can be further used for making predictions and recommendations in the production environment.

Sure, here is an example Python script for training a complex machine learning algorithm (Gradient Boosting Classifier) for the Peru Vocational Training AI application using mock data:

### File Path: `/models/train_complex_model.py`

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import numpy as np

## Generate mock data for training
X = np.random.rand(100, 10)  ## Mock features data
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)  ## Mock target data

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Initialize and train the Gradient Boosting Classifier
gb_classifier = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3)
gb_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = gb_classifier.predict(X_test)

## Calculate the accuracy of the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy of the model: {accuracy}")

## Save the trained model (if needed)
## Note: This specific model does not need to be saved as it is not neural network based.

```
