Here is a sample Dockerfile tailored for the production deployment of the machine learning model in the Employee Productivity Enhancer project in Peru, optimized for performance and scalability:

```dockerfile
## Use a base image with Python and machine learning libraries pre-installed
FROM python:3.9-slim

## Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

## Copy the requirements file and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

## Copy the preprocessed model data and the model file
COPY preprocessed_data.csv /app
COPY employee_productivity_model.pkl /app

## Copy the model deployment script
COPY model_deploy.py /app

## Expose the port the API will run on
EXPOSE 5000

## Command to run the model deployment script
CMD ["python", "model_deploy.py"]
```

### Dockerfile Configuration Details:

1. **Base Image:** Utilizes the Python 3.9-slim image to minimize the container size and optimize performance.
2. **Dependencies Installation:** Installs the required libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file for the model deployment.
3. **Data and Model Files:** Copies the preprocessed data, trained model file, and deployment script to the container.
4. **Exposed Port:** Exposes port 5000 for running the API to interact with the model.
5. **Command to Run:** Executes the `model_deploy.py` script for deploying the machine learning model in the container.

### Instructions:

1. Ensure the `requirements.txt`, `preprocessed_data.csv`, `employee_productivity_model.pkl`, and `model_deploy.py` files are in the same directory as the Dockerfile.
2. Modify the Dockerfile according to any specific performance or scalability requirements for your project.
3. Build the Docker image using `docker build -t employee_productivity_model .`.
4. Run the Docker container with `docker run -p 5000:5000 employee_productivity_model` to deploy the machine learning model.

This Dockerfile provides a robust container setup, encapsulating the project environment and dependencies for optimized performance and scalability during the deployment of the machine learning model for the Employee Productivity Enhancer project.
