This structure facilitates the tracking of model versions, reproducibility of experiments, and sharing of model artifacts or configuration details across the development team.

As the focus of the AutoML pipeline is on the training and experimentation process, the deployment of the trained models is an essential step towards leveraging the models for inference and production use. The suggested structure for the `deployment/` directory is as follows:

```
deployment/
│
├── model_serving/
│   ├── model_1/
│   │   ├── model_version_1/
│   │   │   ├── model_artifact.pkl
│   │   │   ├── preprocessing_pipeline.pkl
│   │   │   ├── inference_script.py
│   │   │   └── requirements.txt
│   │   └── model_version_2/
│   │       ├── model_artifact.pkl
│   │       ├── preprocessing_pipeline.pkl

By organizing the deployment directory in this manner, it becomes more straightforward to manage and deploy different versions of the models, track the pre-processing pipelines, and set up monitoring for model performance in production. Additionally, this structure enables the deployment team to easily access and manage the artifacts required for serving the trained models while maintaining visibility into the performance of the deployed models.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def complex_machine_learning_algorithm(data_file_path):
    ## Load mock data from the specified file path
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Preprocessing the data
    X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = data['target']
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Initialize the model (in this case, a Random Forest Classifier)
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    ## Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    ## Evaluate the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    return model, accuracy
```

In this function:

- The `complex_machine_learning_algorithm` function takes a file path as input, assuming the file contains mock data in a CSV format.
- It preprocesses the data, splitting it into features (X) and the target variable (y), and further divides the data into training and testing sets.
- A Random Forest Classifier model is initialized and trained on the training data.
- After training, the model makes predictions on the test set, and the accuracy of the model is evaluated using the `accuracy_score` metric.
- The function returns the trained model and its accuracy for further analysis or deployment.

To use this function, the file path to the mock data should be passed as an argument. For example:

```python
data_file_path = 'path_to_mock_data.csv'  ## Replace with the actual file path
trained_model, accuracy = complex_machine_learning_algorithm(data_file_path)
print("Model trained and evaluated with accuracy:", accuracy)
```

This function demonstrates a simplified version of a typical machine learning algorithm and can be used as part of the automated pipeline, integrating with AutoML tools to perform model selection and hyperparameter tuning.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def complex_deep_learning_algorithm(data_file_path):
    ## Load mock data from the specified file path
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Preprocessing the data
    X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = data['target']

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Standardize the data
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

    ## Build a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

    ## Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    ## Evaluate the model
    y_pred = (model.predict(X_test) > 0.5).astype("int32")
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    return model, accuracy
```

In this function:

- The `complex_deep_learning_algorithm` function takes a file path as input, assuming the file contains mock data in a CSV format.
- It preprocesses the data, splitting it into features (X) and the target variable (y), and further divides the data into training and testing sets.
- The data is standardized using the `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn.
- A deep learning model is constructed using TensorFlow/Keras, comprising a fully connected neural network with relu activation and a final sigmoid output layer.
- The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.
- The model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the test data using accuracy as the evaluation metric.
- The function returns the trained deep learning model and its accuracy for further analysis or deployment.

To use this function, the file path to the mock data should be passed as an argument. For example:

```python
data_file_path = 'path_to_mock_data.csv'  ## Replace with the actual file path
trained_model, accuracy = complex_deep_learning_algorithm(data_file_path)
print("Model trained and evaluated with accuracy:", accuracy)
```

This function serves as a demonstration of a complex deep learning algorithm that can be utilized within the automated pipeline, potentially integrated with AutoML tools to facilitate model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
