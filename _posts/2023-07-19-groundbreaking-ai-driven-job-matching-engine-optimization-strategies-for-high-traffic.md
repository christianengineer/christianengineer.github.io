# AI-Driven Job Matching Engine Repository

## Description
This repository is intended to serve as a centralized source for all the code, tools, libraries, and documentation needed to operate, maintain, and improve our AI-Driven Job Matching Engine. 

The Job Matching Engine is an innovative product leveraging state-of-the-art AI technologies to match job seekers with the most suitable job opportunities available in the market. It comprehends the candidates' skills, experiences, and preferences, matches them with the job requirements and organizational culture, and then recommends the most appropriate opportunities. This is a breakthrough in modern recruitment processes and aims to disrupt the human resources industry.

## Goals
The main objectives of this repository are:
1. To provide a centralized place for code storage and version control.
2. To facilitate the collaboration between our team members, enabling them to work on different features or functionalities concurrently while avoiding code conflicts.
3. To preserve the history of the project and its evolution.
4. To ensure the consistency and integrity of our codebase.
5. To facilitate the process of testing, debugging, and deploying our product.

## Libraries 
For efficient data handling, the AI-Driven Job Matching Engine will leverage powerful Python libraries such as:

1. **Pandas**: This is a highly-optimized library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.
2. **Numpy**: A Python library used for dealing with numerical data structures.
3. **Scikit-learn**: This is a machine learning library that will be used to develop prediction models for job matching.

For handling user traffic and ensuring scalability, the following technologies will be used:

1. **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime enabling us to develop scalable server-side applications.
2. **Express.js**: This Web application framework for Node.js will help us design our application's server-side logic and handle HTTP requests.
3. **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for large volume data storage.
4. **Mongoose**: This is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library used to provide a straightforward, schema-based solution to model our application data.

## Conclusion
This repository aims to provide a comprehensive package for the AI-Driven Job Matching Engine. It's designed to facilitate collaboration and ensure high-quality code production, necessary for the successful execution and maintenance of the project. Using the above-mentioned libraries and technologies, the product will assure efficient data handling and scalable user traffic, thereby ensuring optimal user experience.

# AI-Driven Job Matching Engine Repository File Structure

This document outlines a scalable file structure for the AI-Driven Job Matching Engine.

## File Structure Diagram

Below is a tentative view of the file structure for the project repository:

```
/Job_Matching_Engine
|-- /client
|   |-- /src
|   |   |-- /components
|   |   |-- /services
|   |   |-- /styles
|   |   |-- index.js

# AI-Driven Job Matching Engine Logic File

The primary logic for the AI-Driven Job Matching Engine will be contained in a Python file named `job_matching_engine.py`. Here is a hypothetical look at the file and its location in the repository.

## Directory Location

```
/Job_Matching_Engine
|-- /server
|   |-- /controllers
|   |   |-- job_matching_engine.py
|...
```
## File Contents

Below is a fictitious content example for `job_matching_engine.py`:

```python
# Import Necessary Libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import linear_kernel

class JobMatchingEngine:

    def __init__(self):
        self.data = pd.read_csv('./data/jobs.csv')
        self.vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
        self.data['description'] = self.data['description'].fillna('')
        self.content_matrix = self.vectorizer.fit_transform(self.data['description'])

    def recommend_jobs(self, profile):
        profile_vec = self.vectorizer.transform([profile])
        cosine_sim = linear_kernel(profile_vec, self.content_matrix)
        similarity_scores = list(enumerate(cosine_sim[0]))
        similarity_scores = sorted(similarity_scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        job_indices = [i[0] for i in similarity_scores]
        return self.data.iloc[job_indices]


if __name__ == "__main__":
    engine = JobMatchingEngine()
    profile = "Software Development"
    recommended_jobs = engine.recommend_jobs(profile)
    print(recommended_jobs)
```

In this file, we're creating a simple content-based recommender system that uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity to recommend jobs based on the provided profile.

Note: This is a very basic representation. The actual file would involve more complex and comprehensive code to account for a variety of cases and edge scenarios.
```
Please note that this is a basic setup. The actual code would require handling exceptions, validation checks, other complex logic for matching profiles to job descriptions, considerations for scalability, and more.
