This file structure provides a clear separation of concerns, with separate modules for analytics and inventory management on the backend. It also includes a frontend module for the user interface. The `frontend` directory follows a typical React project structure with separate folders for components, containers, Redux-related files, services, and styles.

The `datasets` directory is intended for storing training and testing data sets used for predictive analytics. The `utils` directory can be used to store utility functions and other helper modules that can be shared across different parts of the application.

Additionally, the project includes a `tests` directory for unit and integration tests, as well as a `requirements.txt` file for managing Python dependencies. The `webpack.config.js` file is provided for configuring the frontend build process, while `manage.py` is Django's management script.

Please note that this is a suggested file structure and can be adjusted based on your specific requirements.

Certainly! Here's an example of a file, named `inventory_analytics.py`, that contains the core logic for predictive analytics in the retail inventory management system. The file path is within the `analytics` module.

File Path: `analytics/inventory_analytics.py`

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def predict_demand(inventory_data):
    # Preprocess inventory data and extract features
    # ...

    # Train a Linear Regression model on historical data
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Perform demand prediction on new data
    predicted_demand = model.predict(X_test)

    return predicted_demand

def calculate_optimal_order_quantity(predicted_demand, current_inventory, lead_time):
    # Calculate reorder point and order quantity using demand forecasts and inventory parameters
    # ...

    # Return optimal order quantity
    return optimal_order_quantity

def calculate_reorder_schedules(inventory_items):
    reorder_schedules = []

    for item in inventory_items:
        predicted_demand = predict_demand(item.historical_data)
        optimal_order_quantity = calculate_optimal_order_quantity(
            predicted_demand, item.current_inventory, item.lead_time
        )

        # Create reorder schedule for each item
        schedule = {
            'item_id': item.id,
            'reorder_quantity': optimal_order_quantity,
            'reorder_date': calculate_reorder_date(item.lead_time)
        }
        reorder_schedules.append(schedule)

    return reorder_schedules

def calculate_reorder_date(lead_time):
    # Calculate the expected reorder date based on lead time and other factors
    # ...

    return reorder_date

```

In this file, we have defined several functions. The `predict_demand` function takes in inventory data, preprocesses it, and trains a Linear Regression model to predict demand. The `calculate_optimal_order_quantity` function uses the demand forecasts, current inventory, and lead time to calculate the optimal order quantity for each item. The `calculate_reorder_schedules` function calculates reorder schedules for all inventory items by calling the appropriate functions and returning a list of reorder schedules. Finally, the `calculate_reorder_date` function calculates the expected reorder date based on the lead time.

These functions can be further extended and customized based on the specific requirements and business rules of the retail inventory management system.

Note: This is just an example of the core logic file, and the actual implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements and data structures in your project.

Certainly! Here's an example of another file named `inventory_management.py` that represents the core logic for inventory management in the Predictive Analytics for Retail Inventory Management system. This file showcases how it can integrate with other files and modules.

File Path: `inventory/inventory_management.py`

```python
from analytics.inventory_analytics import calculate_reorder_schedules
from .models import Item, Order

def update_inventory():
    # Retrieve all inventory items
    inventory_items = Item.objects.all()

    # Calculate reorder schedules using predictive analytics
    reorder_schedules = calculate_reorder_schedules(inventory_items)

    # Process reorder schedules
    for schedule in reorder_schedules:
        item = Item.objects.get(id=schedule['item_id'])
        order_quantity = schedule['reorder_quantity']
        reorder_date = schedule['reorder_date']

        # Create an Order for the item
        order = Order.objects.create(item=item, quantity=order_quantity, order_date=reorder_date)

        # Simulate the order placement and update inventory
        simulate_order_placement(order)

def simulate_order_placement(order):
    # Perform order placement and update inventory accordingly
    # ...

    # Update the current inventory level
    order.item.current_inventory += order.quantity
    order.item.save()
```

In this file, we import the `calculate_reorder_schedules` function from the `analytics.inventory_analytics` module to calculate reorder schedules based on predictive analytics. The `update_inventory` function retrieves all inventory items, calculates the reorder schedules, and processes each schedule by creating an `Order` instance for the item and simulating the order placement using the `simulate_order_placement` function.

The `simulate_order_placement` function can be further implemented to account for various inventory management strategies, such as updating stock levels, handling backorders, or integrating with external systems for order placement.

By integrating the `calculate_reorder_schedules` function from the `inventory_analytics.py` file, the `inventory_management.py` file leverages the predicted demand and other parameters to make data-driven decisions for inventory replenishment.

Please note that this is just an example to illustrate the integration of different modules within the inventory management system, and the actual implementation may vary depending on your specific requirements and codebase structure.

Certainly! Here's an example of another file named `sales_analysis.py` that represents an additional core logic for sales analysis in the Predictive Analytics for Retail Inventory Management system. This file showcases its role in the overall system and interdependencies with the previously outlined files.

File Path: `analytics/sales_analysis.py`

```python
from inventory.models import Item, Order

def calculate_sales_metrics():
    # Retrieve all orders in the system
    orders = Order.objects.all()

    # Calculate sales metrics for each item
    sales_metrics = []
    for item in Item.objects.all():
        sales_data = [order.quantity for order in orders.filter(item=item)]
        total_sales = sum(sales_data)
        average_sales = total_sales / len(sales_data) if sales_data else 0

        # Create sales metric object
        sales_metric = {
            'item_id': item.id,
            'total_sales': total_sales,
            'average_sales': average_sales
        }
        sales_metrics.append(sales_metric)

    return sales_metrics

def analyze_sales_trends():
    # Calculate sales metrics
    sales_metrics = calculate_sales_metrics()

    # Analyze sales trends based on sales metrics
    # ...

    return sales_trends
```

In this file, we define the `calculate_sales_metrics` function, which retrieves all orders in the system and calculates sales metrics for each item. It calculates the total sales and average sales for each item based on order quantities. The results are stored in a list of sales metrics.

The `analyze_sales_trends` function utilizes the sales metrics calculated by the `calculate_sales_metrics` function to analyze sales trends. This function can further analyze and interpret the sales data to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can aid in decision-making for inventory management and business strategies.

By integrating with the `Item` and `Order` models, this file establishes interdependencies with the `inventory_management.py` file (for updating inventory) and the `inventory_analytics.py` file (for predictive analytics). Sales analysis can provide valuable insights into product demand, which can influence reorder schedules, inventory management decisions, and predictive models.

These interdependencies create a cohesive system where sales analysis complements predictive analytics and inventory management to optimize inventory operations and enhance business strategies.

Please note that this is just an example to illustrate the integration of different modules within the retail inventory management system, and the actual implementation may vary based on your specific requirements and codebase structure.
