I will provide a sample Python script for training a TensorFlow model using mock data for the Energy Cost Reduction Advisor application. Please find below the file content along with the file path:

### File Path: `models/training/train_model.py`

```python
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load mock energy usage data
data_path = 'data/processed_data/mock_energy_data.csv'
energy_data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

# Define features and target variable
X = energy_data.drop(columns=['energy_usage'])
y = energy_data['energy_usage']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define and train a TensorFlow model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Save the trained model
model.save('deployment/model/saved_model')
```

This script loads mock energy usage data, preprocesses it, trains a TensorFlow model on the data, and saves the trained model for deployment. The mock data file should be stored at `data/processed_data/mock_energy_data.csv`.

This file demonstrates a simplistic model training process using TensorFlow that can be further refined and optimized for the specific requirements of the Energy Cost Reduction Advisor application for Peru households.

I will provide a sample Python script for training a more complex machine learning algorithm, such as a Gradient Boosting Regressor, using mock data for the Energy Cost Reduction Advisor application. Please find below the file content along with the file path:

### File Path: `models/training/train_complex_model.py`

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load mock energy usage data
data_path = 'data/processed_data/mock_energy_data.csv'
energy_data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

# Define features and target variable
X = energy_data.drop(columns=['energy_usage'])
y = energy_data['energy_usage']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Gradient Boosting Regressor model
gb_regressor = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3, random_state=42)
gb_regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
y_pred = gb_regressor.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')

# Save the trained model (if required)
# model_path = 'deployment/model/complex_model.pkl'
# joblib.dump(gb_regressor, model_path)
```

This script demonstrates training a more complex machine learning algorithm, a Gradient Boosting Regressor, on mock energy usage data. It splits the data, trains the model, evaluates its performance, and optionally saves the trained model. The mock data file should be stored at `data/processed_data/mock_energy_data.csv`.

This script can be further extended with hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and cross-validation to enhance the model's performance for the Energy Cost Reduction Advisor application for Peru households.
