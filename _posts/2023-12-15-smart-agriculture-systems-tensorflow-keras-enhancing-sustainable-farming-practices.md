Sure! Below is an example of a Python script for training a machine learning model using mock data for the Smart Agriculture Systems application. This script uses TensorFlow and Keras to build and train a simple model. Note that this script assumes the mock data is already prepared and available in a suitable format.

Here's a sample file path for the training script:

**File Path:** `src/model_training.py`

```python
## src/model_training.py

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

## Mock data - Replace with actual mock data
X = np.random.random((100, 10))  ## Sample feature matrix
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)  ## Sample target variable

## Data preprocessing and splitting
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Define the model architecture (example: simple feedforward neural network)
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))

## Save the trained model
model.save('models/trained_models/sustainable_farming_model.h5')
```

In this example, the script utilizes mock data for training a simple neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras. It preprocesses the data, constructs the model architecture, compiles the model, trains it on the mock data, and saves the trained model to the specified file path (`models/trained_models/sustainable_farming_model.h5`).

Please note that in a real-world scenario, the mock data should be replaced with actual agricultural data relevant to the sustainable farming application. Additionally, more complex model architectures and data preprocessing steps may be necessary for practical use cases.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a complex machine learning algorithm using mock data for the Smart Agriculture Systems application. This script leverages TensorFlow and Keras to construct a more complex deep learning model. As before, the script assumes the availability of mock data in a suitable format.

Here's a sample file path for the training script:

**File Path:** `src/complex_model_training.py`

```python
## src/complex_model_training.py

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow.keras import layers

## Mock data - Replace with actual mock data
X = np.random.random((1000, 20))  ## Sample feature matrix
y = np.random.random((1000, 1))   ## Sample target variable

## Data preprocessing and splitting
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Define the complex model architecture (example: deep neural network)
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(20,)),
    layers.Dropout(0.3),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.4),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1)  ## Regression without activation, custom output
])

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='mean_squared_error',
              metrics=['mean_absolute_error'])

## Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))

## Save the trained model
model.save('models/trained_models/complex_sustainable_farming_model.h5')
```

In this example, the script constructs a more complex deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras, and utilizes the mock data for training. It preprocesses the data, builds the deep neural network architecture, compiles the model, trains it on the mock data, and saves the trained model to the specified file path (`models/trained_models/complex_sustainable_farming_model.h5`).

It is important to note that while this example uses mock data for illustration, in a real-world scenario, relevant agricultural data should be utilized to train such complex models. Additionally, additional preprocessing and feature engineering steps may be required for practical application of the model.
