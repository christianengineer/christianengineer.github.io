Certainly! Below is a Python function that represents a simplified example of a machine learning algorithm for credit scoring using XGBoost. The function takes mock data as input and demonstrates the process of loading a trained XGBoost model from a file and making predictions on the input data:

```python
import pandas as pd
import xgboost as xgb
import os

def credit_scoring_prediction(data: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Perform credit scoring prediction using a trained XGBoost model.

    Args:
    - data: Input data for credit scoring prediction (mock data).

    Returns:
    - predictions: Predicted credit scores for the input data.
    """
    ## Load the trained XGBoost model from file
    model_file_path = 'models/xgboost_model.pkl'
    if not os.path.isfile(model_file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError("XGBoost model file not found. Please ensure the model file exists at the specified path.")

    ## Assuming 'data' contains the necessary input features for the XGBoost model
    ## Preprocess the input data if required before making predictions

    ## Load the trained model
    trained_model = xgb.Booster()
    trained_model.load_model(model_file_path)

    ## Make predictions on the input data
    dmatrix = xgb.DMatrix(data)
    predictions = trained_model.predict(dmatrix)

    ## Assuming the predictions are returned as a DataFrame with the same indices as the input data
    return pd.DataFrame(predictions, index=data.index, columns=['credit_score'])
```

In this example:

- The `credit_scoring_prediction` function takes a Pandas DataFrame `data` as input, representing the mock input data for credit scoring prediction.
- It loads the trained XGBoost model from the file path `'models/xgboost_model.pkl'`.
- The input data is preprocessed if necessary before making predictions using the loaded model.
- Finally, the function returns a Pandas DataFrame `predictions` containing the predicted credit scores for the input data.

This function demonstrates the process of utilizing a trained XGBoost model to make predictions on mock input data for credit scoring within the "Credit Scoring with XGBoost" application.

Certainly! Below is a Python function that encapsulates a complex machine learning algorithm using XGBoost for the Credit Scoring application. This function assumes the presence of a trained XGBoost model saved as a file and takes mock data as input to make creditworthiness predictions.

```python
import pandas as pd
import xgboost as xgb
import os

def credit_scoring_prediction(input_data: pd.DataFrame, model_file_path: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Perform credit scoring prediction using a trained XGBoost model.

    Args:
    - input_data: Input data for credit scoring prediction (mock data) in a Pandas DataFrame format.
    - model_file_path: File path to the trained XGBoost model.

    Returns:
    - predictions: Predicted credit scores for the input data in a Pandas DataFrame format.
    """
    ## Check if the model file exists
    if not os.path.exists(model_file_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError("The provided model file path does not exist.")

    ## Load the trained XGBoost model
    model = xgb.Booster()
    model.load_model(model_file_path)

    ## Perform any necessary preprocessing on the input_data
    processed_data = preprocess_input_data(input_data)  ## Assuming a preprocessing function is defined

    ## Convert input data to DMatrix format
    input_dmatrix = xgb.DMatrix(processed_data)

    ## Make predictions using the loaded model
    predictions = model.predict(input_dmatrix)

    ## Create a DataFrame of predictions
    result = pd.DataFrame(predictions, columns=["credit_score"], index=input_data.index)

    return result
```

In this function:

- The `credit_scoring_prediction` function takes two arguments:
  - `input_data`: Represents the mock input data for credit scoring prediction in a Pandas DataFrame format.
  - `model_file_path`: Indicates the file path to the trained XGBoost model.
- It checks the existence of the model file and loads the trained XGBoost model using the provided file path.
- Any necessary preprocessing of the input data is performed before making predictions using the loaded model.
- The function returns a Pandas DataFrame `result` containing the predicted credit scores for the input data.

This function can be used within the Credit Scoring application to make creditworthiness predictions based on the trained XGBoost model and mock input data.
