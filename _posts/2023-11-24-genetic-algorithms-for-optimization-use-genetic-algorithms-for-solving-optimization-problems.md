from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

def perform_complex_ml_algorithm(data_path):
    """

    Parameters:
    - data_path (str): File path to the mock dataset for model training and optimization.

    Returns:
    - float: Mean cross-validated score of the trained model.
    """
    ## Load mock dataset for training
    data = np.load(data_path)

    ## Extract features and target variable
    X = data[:, :-1]
    y = data[:, -1]

    ## Initialize the hyperparameters to be optimized by genetic algorithms
    ## Example: max_depth, n_estimators
    max_depth = 5
    n_estimators = 100

    ## Instantiate a Random Forest Regressor with default hyperparameters
    reg_model = RandomForestRegressor(max_depth=max_depth, n_estimators=n_estimators, random_state=42)

        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])

    ## Compile the model with optimizer, loss, and metrics
