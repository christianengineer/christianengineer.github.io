## Objectives of the Repository
The AI Automated Anomaly Detection in Financial Transactions repository aims to build a scalable and data-intensive system for detecting anomalies and potential fraud in financial transactions using machine learning. The key objectives include:

1. Implementing an efficient anomaly detection model using Keras, a high-level neural networks API.
2. Integrating Kafka, a distributed streaming platform, for real-time processing of financial transaction data.
3. Utilizing Prometheus, a monitoring and alerting toolkit, for tracking the performance and health of the anomaly detection system.

## System Design Strategies
To achieve the objectives, the following system design strategies can be employed:

1. **Scalable Data Ingestion:** Use Kafka for real-time ingestion of financial transaction data. Kafka's distributed nature allows for horizontal scaling to handle large volumes of data efficiently.
2. **Machine Learning Model:** Develop a deep learning anomaly detection model using Keras, capable of identifying patterns indicative of fraudulent transactions.
3. **Real-time Processing:** Utilize Kafka for real-time processing of transaction data, enabling immediate anomaly detection and rapid response to potential fraud.
4. **Monitoring and Alerting:** Integrate Prometheus for monitoring the performance metrics of the system, enabling proactive identification of issues and anomalies in the anomaly detection process.

## Chosen Libraries
The following libraries have been selected for their suitability in achieving the objectives of the repository:

1. **Keras:** A high-level neural networks API, offering ease of use, modularity, and extensibility for building complex deep learning models efficiently.
2. **Kafka:** A distributed streaming platform that provides scalable, fault-tolerant ingestion and processing of real-time data, making it ideal for processing financial transaction streams.
3. **Prometheus:** A monitoring and alerting toolkit that enables the tracking of performance metrics and the generation of alerts based on predefined thresholds, ensuring the health and stability of the anomaly detection system.

By leveraging these libraries within the repository, the objective of building a scalable, data-intensive anomaly detection system for financial transactions can be effectively realized.

## MLOps Infrastructure for Automated Anomaly Detection in Financial Transactions

The MLOps infrastructure for the Automated Anomaly Detection in Financial Transactions application involves several key components to enable the seamless deployment, monitoring, and management of the machine learning model and associated data processing pipelines. The infrastructure revolves around integrating MLOps principles with the existing tech stack, including Keras, Kafka, and Prometheus, to ensure smooth AI application development and operation. Here are the key components of the MLOps infrastructure:

1. **Model Training and Deployment Pipeline:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline for training, validating, and deploying the anomaly detection model built using Keras. This involves version control of machine learning code and model artifacts, automated testing, and deployment to various environments.

2. **Data Versioning and Monitoring:** Employ a data versioning system to track changes in input data and ensure reproducibility of model training. Additionally, set up monitoring for data quality and distribution shifts to alert on potential issues in the input data.

3. **Real-time Data Processing with Kafka:** Integrate Kafka for real-time data streaming and event-driven model inference. This involves setting up Kafka topics to receive transaction data, processing the data with the anomaly detection model, and pushing alerts for potential fraudulent transactions.

4. **Model Monitoring and Experiment Tracking:** Utilize dedicated tools or platforms for model monitoring and experiment tracking to capture model performance metrics, identify model drift, and compare the performance of different model versions.

5. **Alerting and Incident Response:** Configure alerting mechanisms to notify relevant stakeholders when anomalies are detected. This involves setting up alert thresholds based on model outputs and performance metrics tracked by Prometheus.

6. **Infrastructure Scaling and Resource Management:** Implement strategies for auto-scaling infrastructure resources based on demand, optimizing resource allocation, and ensuring high availability and reliability of the entire MLOps infrastructure.

7. **Security and Compliance:** Incorporate robust security measures to safeguard sensitive financial data and ensure compliance with industry regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS). This includes secure data handling, access control, and encryption of data in transit and at rest.

By integrating these components into the MLOps infrastructure, the Automated Anomaly Detection in Financial Transactions application can benefit from streamlined model development, seamless deployment, real-time data processing, proactive monitoring, and effective incident response, ultimately contributing to the prevention of fraudulent activities.

Certainly! Below is a sample file for training a model for the Automated Anomaly Detection in Financial Transactions application using mock data. This file demonstrates the training process for the anomaly detection model using Keras. For the purpose of this example, let's assume that the file is named `train_model.py` and is located in the `src` directory of the project:

```python
# File: automated-anomaly-detection/src/train_model.py

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.optimizers import Adam

# Load mock financial transactions data
data_path = "path_to_mock_data/financial_transactions.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

# Perform data preprocessing
# For the purpose of this example, assume that data preprocessing includes feature engineering and normalization
# Example: 
# data = perform_feature_engineering(data)
# ...

# Define input features and target variable
X = data.drop(columns=['transaction_id', 'label_column'])
y = data['label_column']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Feature scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Build the anomaly detection model using Keras
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, input_dim=X.shape[1], activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001), metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Evaluate model performance
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Model Evaluation - Loss: {loss}, Accuracy: {accuracy}')

# Save the trained model
model.save("path_to_save_model/anomaly_detection_model.h5")
```

In this file, the mock financial transactions data is loaded from a CSV file, preprocessed, and split into training and testing sets. The Keras sequential model is defined, compiled, trained, and evaluated using the mock data. Finally, the trained model is saved to a file for future deployment and inference.

# Feature scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Build a complex deep learning model for anomaly detection
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(128, input_shape=(X.shape[1],), activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.5),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.5),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model with early stopping
early_stopping = callbacks.EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=5, restore_best_weights=True)

history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), callbacks=[early_stopping])

# Evaluate model performance
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Model Evaluation - Loss: {loss}, Accuracy: {accuracy}')

# Save the trained model
model.save("path_to_save_model/complex_anomaly_detection_model.h5")
```
