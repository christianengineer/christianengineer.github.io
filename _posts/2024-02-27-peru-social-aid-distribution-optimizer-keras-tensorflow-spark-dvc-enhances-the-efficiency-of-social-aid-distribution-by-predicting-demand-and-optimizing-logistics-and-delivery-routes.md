I'll provide a Python script for training a demand prediction model using mock data for the Peru Social Aid Distribution Optimizer project. We will simulate the training process using Keras and TensorFlow. Let's consider the file path as `scripts/train_demand_prediction_model.py`.

```python
# train_demand_prediction_model.py

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint

# Generate mock data for training
np.random.seed(42)
num_samples = 1000
features = np.random.rand(num_samples, 3)  # Mock features (3 input features)
target = 2 * features[:, 0] + 3 * features[:, 1] - 1.5 * features[:, 2] + np.random.normal(0, 1, num_samples)  # Mock target variable

# Split data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define a simple feedforward neural network model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(3,)))
model.add(Dense(1))  # Output layer

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Use ModelCheckpoint callback to save the best model during training
checkpoint_callback = ModelCheckpoint('models/keras_models/demand_prediction_model.h5', monitor='val_loss', save_best_only=True)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_val, y_val), epochs=50, batch_size=32, callbacks=[checkpoint_callback])

# Save the final model
model.save('models/keras_models/demand_prediction_model_final.h5')

print("Training completed. Model saved.")
```

In this script:
- We generate mock data for training the demand prediction model.
- We split the data into training and validation sets.
- We define a simple feedforward neural network model using Keras.
- We compile the model with an optimizer and loss function.
- We use a `ModelCheckpoint` callback to save the best model during training.
- We train the model on the mock data.
- We save the final trained model.

We save the trained model as `demand_prediction_model.h5` in the `models/keras_models/` directory, and also save the final trained model as `demand_prediction_model_final.h5`.

This script simulates the training process for the demand prediction model and saves the trained model for deployment in the Peru Social Aid Distribution Optimizer project.

I'll provide a Python script for implementing a complex machine learning algorithm for route optimization using Spark with mock data for the Peru Social Aid Distribution Optimizer project. Let's consider the file path as `optimization/route_optimization_algorithm.py`.

```python
# route_optimization_algorithm.py

from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
from pyspark.ml.regression import RandomForestRegressor
from pyspark.ml import Pipeline
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import RegressionEvaluator

# Create Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("RouteOptimization") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Generate mock data for route optimization
num_samples = 1000
features = spark.sparkContext.parallelize([(1.2, 2.3, 3.4), (4.5, 5.6, 6.7)] * (num_samples//2))
data = features.map(lambda x: (x, x[0] + x[1] + x[2] + 0.1))

# Create DataFrame from the mock data
df = data.toDF(["features", "label"])

# Vectorize features
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=["features"], outputCol="features_vec")
df_vectorized = assembler.transform(df)

# Split data into training and testing sets
train_data, test_data = df_vectorized.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2], seed=42)

# Build the Random Forest regression model
rf = RandomForestRegressor(featuresCol="features_vec", labelCol="label")

# Create a Pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[rf])

# Train the model
model = pipeline.fit(train_data)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.transform(test_data)

# Evaluate the model
evaluator = RegressionEvaluator(labelCol="label", predictionCol="prediction", metricName="rmse")
rmse = evaluator.evaluate(predictions)

print(f"Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on test data: {rmse}")

# Save the Trained Model
model.stages[0].save("models/spark_models/route_optimization_model")

# Stop the Spark session
spark.stop()
```

In this script:
- We create a Spark session to handle distributed computations.
- We generate mock data for route optimization.
- We create a DataFrame from the mock data and vectorize the features.
- We split the data into training and testing sets.
- We build a Random Forest regression model using PySpark's MLlib.
- We create a pipeline and train the model on the training data.
- We make predictions on the test data and evaluate the model performance using RMSE.
- We save the trained model in the `models/spark_models/` directory.

This script simulates the training and evaluation process of a complex machine learning algorithm for route optimization using Spark and saves the trained model for deployment in the Peru Social Aid Distribution Optimizer project.
