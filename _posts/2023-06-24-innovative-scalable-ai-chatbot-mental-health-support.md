## **Chatbot for Mental Health Support Repository**

---

### **Description**

The repository is dedicated to the creation and development of a chatbot meant to provide first-level assistance for mental health. Our objective is to offer an easily accessible tool for individuals dealing with various mental health issues like anxiety, depression, PTSD and so forth. The chatbot is programmed to make initial contact with users, answer their queries, provide immediate assistance or redirect them to the right channels for professional help.

This software is not intended to replace professional treatment, but to serve as an immediate point of help and to function as a bridge, facilitating the path towards expert attention when necessary. 

---

### **Goals**

1. **Accessibility and Engagement**: Give users an instant and accessible tool to deal with mental health issues.
   
2. **First-Level Assistance**: Ensure the chatbot can provide preliminary suggestions based on user queries.

3. **Information Channel**: Direct users to resources, guidance, and professional mental health services as needed.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Ensure a seamless and responsive user experience.

5. **Scalability and Adaptability**: The tool should be capable of scaling up to handle increasing traffic and should be adaptable to various platforms, like web, Android, iOS, etc.

---

### **Libraries and Technologies**

The following libraries and technologies will be used for development, data handling and handling user traffic efficiently:

1. **Language**: Python, due to simplicity of syntax and wealth of libraries

2. **Backend Framework**: Django, for its scalability and robustness

3. **Frontend Frameworks** : React.js/Angular.js, to create a responsive, dynamic user interface

4. **Database**: PostgreSQL, for excellent concurrency control and scalability features

5. **Natural Language Processing**: NLTK or Spacy, for interpreting user input & providing relevant responses

6. **ML/DL Libraries**: TensorFlow & Keras, for training models for the chatbot's AI

7. **APIs**: Twilio, for potential SMS support, and Google Cloud APIs for possible integration with Google services

8. **Cloud Hosting Platforms**: AWS or Google Cloud Platform, allowing the chatbot to scale in accordance with traffic

9. **Testing Libraries**: Pytest for backend and Jest for frontend to ensure software reliability and performance

10. **Containerization**: Docker, for simplifying deployment and ensuring consistency across development, staging, and production environments

11. **Version Control**: Git, to track and manage code changes in a collaborative environment.

---

This full-stack approach, utilizing industry-standard tools and practices, will ensure the chatbot is built on a robust and scalable infrastructure, capable of providing instant mental health support to those who need it.

File: `chatbot_logic.py`

```python

## ------------------Chatbot Logic------------------ ##
import random
from chatbot.models import chatbot
from chatbot.services import natural_language_processing as nlp, ai_model 

## Generate Basic Greetings
def get_bot_greeting():
    greetings = ['Hello', 'Hi', 'Hey', 'Hi there']
    return random.choice(greetings)

## Generate Response to a simple check-in Question
def check_in_response(user_response):
    assert isinstance(user_response, str), 'Expected a string input'
    check_in_qs = ['How are you doing?', 'How are you feeling today?']
    response = ''

    if user_response in check_in_qs:
        responses = [
            'I\'m a bot, so I don\'t have feelings. But, thank you for asking! How can I assist you today?',
            'Being an AI, I don\'t have personal feelings, but I am here to help you. How can I provide support to you today?'
        ]
        response = random.choice(responses)
    elif 'thank' in user_response:
        response = 'You\'re welcome! If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.'
    else:
        response = 'I\'m sorry, I didn\'t understand that. Could you please rephrase or elaborate?'

    return response

## Developing a response for the user, using NLP and AI Model
def generate_response(user_input):
    # Normalizing input
    normalized_input = nlp.normalize(user_input)

    # Get index of most relevant response using AI model
    most_relevant_index = ai_model.get_most_relevant_response(normalized_input)

    # Get most relevant response detail
    response_detail = chatbot.get_response_detail(most_relevant_index)

    return response_detail

```

This `chatbot_logic.py` file handles the core logic for the chatbot. The `get_bot_greeting` function generates a simple random greeting, while `check_in_response` generates basic responses for simple user queries.

For more advanced user queries, the `generate_response` function uses Natural Language Processing (through the `natural_language_processing.py` service) and a custom AI model (through the `ai_model.py` service) to identify the most relevant response from a predefined list in `chatbot.py` model.

Keep in mind these are just simple examples that don't yet incorporate true machine learning - the real processing will be more complex, and may involve elements such as sentiment analysis and advanced natural language understanding techniques.
