## Objectives
The objective of the AI-enhanced legal document analysis system is to provide a scalable and efficient platform for legal services, leveraging the power of AI and machine learning to analyze legal documents. This involves employing BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for natural language processing tasks, integrating it into a Flask web application, and deploying it using Kubernetes for scalability.

## System Design Strategies
1. **Microservices Architecture**: The system can be designed as a collection of small services that can be independently developed, tested, and deployed, allowing for scalability and flexibility.

2. **Use of BERT for NLP**: BERT will be utilized for tasks such as document classification, entity extraction, and summarization. This will involve pre-training BERT on legal text corpora and fine-tuning it for specific tasks.

3. **Flask Web Application**: The backend of the system can be built using Flask, a lightweight and flexible web framework, to expose the AI capabilities as RESTful APIs that can be easily integrated into other systems.

4. **Kubernetes for Scalability**: Kubernetes can be employed for container orchestration, allowing the system to automatically scale based on demand and ensuring high availability.

5. **Data Pipeline for Document Processing**: Designing an efficient data pipeline to handle large volumes of legal documents, including preprocessing, feature extraction, and transformation for input into the AI models.

## Chosen Libraries
1. **BERT (Transformers)**: For leveraging pre-trained BERT models and fine-tuning them for legal document analysis tasks.

2. **Flask**: As the web framework for building the backend APIs that expose the AI capabilities.

3. **Kubernetes**: For deploying and managing containers to ensure scalability and fault tolerance.

4. **NLTK or Spacy**: For additional NLP tasks such as tokenization, parsing, and named entity recognition, to complement BERT's capabilities.

5. **Pandas/NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis, especially useful for preprocessing legal documents before feeding them to the AI models.

By employing these system design strategies and chosen libraries, the AI-enhanced legal document analysis system can achieve scalability, efficiency, and accuracy in processing and understanding legal texts, providing valuable insights for legal services.

Sure! Below is an example Python script for training a BERT model for the AI-Enhanced Legal Document Analysis. The script uses mock data for demonstration purposes.

- File Path: `app/src/model_training/train_bert.py`

```python
import torch
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification, AdamW
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset
import pandas as pd

# Mock data (replace with actual training data)
data = {
    'text': ['Sample legal document text 1', 'Sample legal document text 2'],
    'label': [1, 0]  # Replace with actual labels for the mock data
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# BERT model and tokenizer
model_name = 'bert-base-uncased'
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, num_labels=2)  # Adjust num_labels based on actual classes

# Tokenize input text
tokenized_input = tokenizer(df['text'].tolist(), padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')

# Create custom dataset
class LegalDocumentDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, tokenized_input, labels):
        self.tokenized_input = tokenized_input
        self.labels = labels

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.labels)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return {key: val[idx] for key, val in self.tokenized_input.items()}, self.labels[idx]

dataset = LegalDocumentDataset(tokenized_input, df['label'].tolist())

# Data loader
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=1, shuffle=True)

# Training loop (Dummy example - replace with actual training process)
optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-5)
for inputs, labels in dataloader:
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(**inputs, labels=labels)
    loss = outputs.loss
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Save trained model
output_dir = './models/trained_models'
model.save_pretrained(output_dir)
tokenizer.save_pretrained(output_dir)
```

In this example, the script demonstrates the training process of a BERT model using mock legal document data. The model is then saved to the `models/trained_models` directory. Replace the mock data and training process with actual data and a more comprehensive training pipeline for your specific use case.

Certainly! Below is an example Python script for a complex machine learning algorithm (e.g., ensemble model) for the AI-Enhanced Legal Document Analysis. The script utilizes mock data for demonstration purposes.

- File Path: `app/src/model_training/train_complex_model.py`

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import joblib

# Mock data (replace with actual data)
data = {
    'text': ['Sample legal document text 1', 'Sample legal document text 2'],
    'label': ['contract', 'judicial opinion'],  # Replace with actual labels for the mock data
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Feature engineering
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000)
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['text'])

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, df['label'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Complex model training (Random Forest as an example)
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Model evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")

# Save trained model
output_path = './models/trained_models/complex_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, output_path)
```

In this example, the script trains a complex machine learning algorithm, a Random Forest classifier as an example, using mock legal document data. The script also saves the trained model to the `models/trained_models` directory. Replace the mock data, feature engineering, and training process with actual data and a more comprehensive machine learning algorithm tailored to your specific use case.
