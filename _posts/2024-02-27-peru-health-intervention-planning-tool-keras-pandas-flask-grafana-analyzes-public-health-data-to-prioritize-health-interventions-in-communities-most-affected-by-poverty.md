## AI Peru Health Intervention Planning Tool

## Objectives
The AI Peru Health Intervention Planning Tool aims to analyze public health data to prioritize health interventions in communities most affected by poverty. The tool will leverage machine learning techniques to identify trends and patterns in the data, allowing for targeted and effective planning of health interventions. 

## System Design Strategies
1. **Data Ingestion**: Utilize Pandas for data ingestion and preprocessing. This includes collecting data from various sources, cleaning, and transforming it into a format suitable for analysis.
  
2. **Machine Learning Model**: Implement machine learning models using Keras. This involves training models on the preprocessed data to predict the impact of different interventions in specific communities.

3. **API Development**: Use Flask to develop a RESTful API that can interact with the machine learning models. This API will allow users to input data, query the models, and receive recommendations for health interventions.

4. **Visualization**: Use Grafana to create interactive and real-time dashboards that visualize the results of the analysis. This will help stakeholders understand the data and make informed decisions.

## Chosen Libraries
1. **Keras**: Chosen for its user-friendly interface, flexibility to build different types of models, and compatibility with popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

2. **Pandas**: Ideal for data manipulation and analysis, Pandas will help in cleaning and preparing the public health data for machine learning modeling.

3. **Flask**: Selected for its simplicity and ease of use in building APIs. Flask will facilitate seamless communication between the frontend interface and the backend machine learning models.

4. **Grafana**: Known for its powerful visualization capabilities, Grafana will be used to create insightful dashboards that provide a clear understanding of the health intervention recommendations based on the data analysis.

By incorporating these libraries and following the system design strategies outlined above, the AI Peru Health Intervention Planning Tool can effectively analyze public health data and prioritize interventions in communities most affected by poverty.

   - Implement logging using ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack to capture and analyze logs for debugging and auditing.

5. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
   - Implement CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins or GitLab CI to automate testing, training, and deployment processes.
   - Ensure reproducibility and consistency in model deployments through automated testing and staging environments.
