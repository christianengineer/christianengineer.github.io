## Primary Focus

The primary focus of this project should be to develop a predictive maintenance model that leverages IoT data, machine learning algorithms, and augmented reality to efficiently manage multiple global estates from a central location. The system should be designed to autonomously handle maintenance, security, and optimization of estates, providing real-time updates and interventions when necessary.

## Target Variable Name

A suitable target variable name for the model that encapsulates the project's goal could be "Estate Health Score." This variable would represent the overall health and maintenance status of each estate in the system. The Estate Health Score can be calculated based on various factors such as equipment performance, maintenance history, security incidents, energy consumption, and environmental conditions.

## Importance of the Target Variable

The Estate Health Score is crucial for this project as it would enable the system to prioritize and allocate resources effectively. By continuously monitoring and updating the Estate Health Score in real-time, the system can proactively identify potential issues, predict maintenance needs, and prevent costly downtimes or security breaches. This target variable serves as a comprehensive metric that encapsulates the overall well-being and performance of each estate, allowing the system to make data-driven decisions for optimal estate management.

## Example Values and Decision Making

- **Estate A**: Health Score = 85
  - Decision: The system can identify that Estate A is operating smoothly with minimal maintenance needs. Regular monitoring and routine inspections can be scheduled to maintain the current health status.

- **Estate B**: Health Score = 60
  - Decision: A lower Health Score indicates potential issues or upcoming maintenance requirements. The system can trigger alerts for specific equipment that may need attention soon, prompting proactive maintenance actions to prevent any operational disruptions.

- **Estate C**: Health Score = 40
  - Decision: A low Health Score signifies critical maintenance or security issues. The system can immediately prioritize Estate C for interventions, allocating resources to address urgent maintenance tasks or security vulnerabilities to avoid any potential risks or failures.

By continuously evaluating estate health through the Estate Health Score, the system can intelligently allocate resources, schedule maintenance tasks, and optimize estate operations to ensure efficient and effective estate management from a central location.

from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Generate fictitious mocked data
data = {
    'EquipmentPerformance': [75, 80, 65, 70, 85],
