```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

def food_quality_assessment_model(file_path):
    ## Load mock data from CSV file
    data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

    ## Preprocessing mock data (example preprocessing steps)
    X = data.drop('quality_label', axis=1)
    y = data['quality_label']

    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Instantiate and train the machine learning model
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    ## Make predictions
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)

    ## Evaluate the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)

        MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),

        Flatten(),
        Dense(512, activation='relu'),
        Dense(3, activation='softmax')  ## Assuming 3 classes for food image classification
    ])

    ## Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
