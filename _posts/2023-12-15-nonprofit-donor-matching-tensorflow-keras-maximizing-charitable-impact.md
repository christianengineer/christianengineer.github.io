Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a machine learning model for the Nonprofit Donor Matching application using mock data. This script utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the model. Let's assume the file is named `train_model.py` and is located within the `models/training/` directory of the project.

### `train_model.py` - Training Script
```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

## Mock training data (replace with actual data loading and preprocessing)
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)  ## Mock feature matrix
y_train = np.random.randint(2, size=(100, 1))  ## Mock target labels

## Define the Keras model
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

## Save the trained model
model.save('models/training/trained_model.h5')
```

This Python script showcases a simple implementation of a training script using mock training data. It creates a mock feature matrix `X_train` and target labels `y_train`, builds a simple neural network model using Keras, compiles the model with an optimizer and loss function, and then trains the model using the mock data. Finally, the trained model is saved to the `models/training/` directory as `trained_model.h5`.

The `train_model.py` script is a starting point for training a machine learning model within the Nonprofit Donor Matching application and serves as a foundation for incorporating actual data and model architectures tailored to the specific requirements of the application.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for implementing a more complex machine learning algorithm, specifically a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras, for the Nonprofit Donor Matching application. This script trains a neural network model with multiple hidden layers and uses mock data for demonstration purposes. Let's assume the file is named `complex_model_training.py` and is located within the `models/training/` directory of the project.

### `complex_model_training.py` - Complex Model Training Script
```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers

## Mock training data (replace with actual data loading and preprocessing)
X_train = np.random.rand(1000, 20)  ## Mock feature matrix
y_train = np.random.randint(2, size=(1000, 1))  ## Mock target labels

## Define a more complex deep learning model using Keras
model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(20,)),
    layers.BatchNormalization(),
    layers.Dropout(0.5),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.BatchNormalization(),
    layers.Dropout(0.5),
    layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=64, validation_split=0.2)

## Save the trained complex model
model.save('models/training/complex_trained_model.h5')
```

In this Python script, a more complex deep learning model is defined using Keras, including multiple hidden layers, batch normalization, and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The script leverages mock training data to train the model and then saves the trained complex model to the `models/training/` directory as `complex_trained_model.h5`.

This `complex_model_training.py` script serves as a demonstration of a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm for the Nonprofit Donor Matching application, showcasing the usage of TensorFlow and Keras to build and train complex neural network models. Actual data and model architecture tailored to the specific requirements of the application would replace the mock data used in this example.
