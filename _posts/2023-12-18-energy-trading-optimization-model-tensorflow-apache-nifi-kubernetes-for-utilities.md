Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a mock model for the Energy Trading Optimization Model using TensorFlow and mock data. The script creates a simple model and trains it using fabricated data. Let's name the file `train_mock_model.py` and place it in the `models/training/` directory:

### File: models/training/train_mock_model.py

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

## Mock data generation
num_samples = 1000
input_features = 5
X = np.random.rand(num_samples, input_features)
y = np.random.randint(2, size=num_samples)

## Define a simple TensorFlow model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_features,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, validation_split=0.2)
```

In this example, the script `train_mock_model.py` generates mock data, creates a simple neural network model using TensorFlow, and trains the model using the fabricated data. This script serves as a placeholder for the actual training process using real-world data and can be further expanded to incorporate actual data preprocessing and feature engineering steps.

This file is now stored in the `models/training/` directory within the Energy Trading Optimization Model repository.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for a more complex machine learning algorithm for the Energy Trading Optimization Model using TensorFlow and mock data. Let's name the file `complex_model.py` and place it in the `models/training/` directory:

### File: models/training/complex_model.py

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

## Mock data generation
num_samples = 1000
input_features = 10
X = np.random.rand(num_samples, input_features)
y = np.random.rand(num_samples, 1)

## Define a more complex TensorFlow model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_features,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='mean_squared_error',
              metrics=['mae', 'mse'])

## Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=20, validation_split=0.2)
```

In this example, the script `complex_model.py` generates mock data, builds and trains a more complex neural network model using TensorFlow. The model architecture includes multiple hidden layers, dropout regularization, and uses mean squared error as the loss function.

This script serves as a placeholder for a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm and can be further customized to incorporate real-world data processing, feature engineering, and validation. It is located in the `models/training/` directory within the Energy Trading Optimization Model repository.
