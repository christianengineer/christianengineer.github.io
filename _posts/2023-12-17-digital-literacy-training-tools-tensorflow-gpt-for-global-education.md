Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a TensorFlow model using mock data. This script assumes the use of TensorFlow for training an image classification model and contains basic functionalities for illustrative purposes.

```python
## File: model_training.py
## Path: code/model_training/tensorflow_models/image_classification/model_1/model_training.py

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

## Mock data generation (replace with actual data loading and preprocessing)
def generate_mock_data():
    num_samples = 1000
    input_shape = (32, 32, 3)  ## Example input shape for image data

    ## Generate random mock images and labels
    mock_images = np.random.rand(num_samples, *input_shape)
    mock_labels = np.random.randint(0, 10, num_samples)  ## Assuming 10 classes for classification

    return mock_images, mock_labels

## Define the model architecture
def build_model(input_shape, num_classes):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
        tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
    ])

    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])

    return model

## Training the mock model
def train_model():
    ## Generate mock data
    images, labels = generate_mock_data()

    ## Build the model
    input_shape = (32, 32, 3)  ## Example input shape for image data
    num_classes = 10  ## Example number of classes for classification
    model = build_model(input_shape, num_classes)

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(images, labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

    ## Save the trained model
    model.save('trained_image_classifier_model.h5')

## Entry point for model training
if __name__ == "__main__":
    train_model()
```

In this example:
- The Python script `model_training.py` is located at the path `code/model_training/tensorflow_models/image_classification/model_1/model_training.py`.
- It includes functions for generating mock data, building a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) model using TensorFlow's Keras API, and training the model using the mock data.
- After training, the script saves the trained model to a file named `trained_image_classifier_model.h5`.

This script serves as a simple example for training a TensorFlow model using mock data, and it can be adapted and expanded upon to train more complex models based on actual data for the Digital Literacy Training Tools application.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for a complex machine learning algorithm using GPT for language modeling. This script assumes the use of OpenAI's GPT-3 and contains basic functionalities for illustrative purposes.

```python
## File: gpt_language_model.py
## Path: code/model_training/gpt_models/language_translation/gpt_language_model.py

import openai

## Set your OpenAI API key
api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
openai.api_key = api_key

## Define function to generate mock input text for language translation
def generate_mock_input_text():
    return "Translate this English text into French."

## Function for language translation using GPT-3
def translate_text(input_text, target_language="fr"):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=f"Translate the following English text into {target_language}: {input_text}",
        max_tokens=100
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

## Main function for language translation
def language_translation_demo():
    ## Generate mock input text
    input_text = generate_mock_input_text()

    ## Perform language translation using GPT-3
    translated_text = translate_text(input_text, target_language="fr")

    ## Print the translated text
    print("Original English Text:", input_text)
    print("Translated Text (French):", translated_text)

## Entry point for language translation demo
if __name__ == "__main__":
    language_translation_demo()
```

In this example:
- The Python script `gpt_language_model.py` is located at the path `code/model_training/gpt_models/language_translation/gpt_language_model.py`.
- It utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 API to demonstrate language translation.
- The script includes a function to generate mock input text for language translation and another function to translate the input text into a target language using GPT-3.
- The main function `language_translation_demo` demonstrates the language translation process by generating mock input text, performing the translation, and displaying the original and translated texts.

This script serves as a basic example for using GPT-3 for language translation, and it can be extended and integrated with real data and additional functionality to support language-related educational applications in the Digital Literacy Training Tools repository.
