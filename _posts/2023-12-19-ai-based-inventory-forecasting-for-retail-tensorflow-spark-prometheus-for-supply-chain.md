Certainly! Below is an example of a Python file for training a TensorFlow model for the AI-based Inventory Forecasting for Retail application. The mock data is used to demonstrate the training process.

**File: train_model.py**

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

## Load mock data (for demonstration purposes)
## Replace the file path with the actual path to the mock data file
data = pd.read_csv('data/processed_data/mock_sales_data.csv')

## Preprocess the data and split into features and target (y)
## ... (data preprocessing steps)

## Split the data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(features, target, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Define the LSTM model
model = Sequential([
    LSTM(units=128, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2])),
    Dense(units=1)
])

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

## Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))

## Save the trained model
model.save('models/tf_models/lstm_demand_forecast/trained_model')
```

In this example, the file `train_model.py` is used to train an LSTM model for demand forecasting using TensorFlow. Mock sales data is loaded from a CSV file, and the necessary data preprocessing steps, model training, and model saving processes are demonstrated.

Please note that the mock data file path `'data/processed_data/mock_sales_data.csv'` should be replaced with the actual path to the mock data file on the system where the training script is being executed.

This file demonstrates the process of training a TensorFlow model with mock data for the AI-based Inventory Forecasting for Retail application, utilizing the specified file structure for the project.

Certainly! Here's an example of a Python file for training a complex machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) using PySpark for the AI-based Inventory Forecasting for Retail application. The mock data is used to demonstrate the training process.

**File: train_spark_model.py**

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
from pyspark.ml.regression import RandomForestRegressor
from pyspark.ml import Pipeline
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import RegressionEvaluator

## Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("InventoryForecastingTraining").getOrCreate()

## Load mock data (for demonstration purposes)
## Replace the file path with the actual path to the mock data file
data = spark.read.csv('data/processed_data/mock_sales_data.csv', header=True, inferSchema=True)

## Data preprocessing and feature engineering
## ... (data preprocessing steps)

## Vectorize features
feature_cols = [...]  ## Define the feature columns
vector_assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")
data = vector_assembler.transform(data)

## Split the data into training and validation sets
train_data, val_data = data.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2], seed=42)

## Define and train the Random Forest model
rf = RandomForestRegressor(featuresCol="features", labelCol="label")
pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[rf])
model = pipeline.fit(train_data)

## Evaluate the model
predictions = model.transform(val_data)
evaluator = RegressionEvaluator(labelCol="label", predictionCol="prediction", metricName="rmse")
rmse = evaluator.evaluate(predictions)
print("Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on validation data = %g" % rmse)

## Save the trained model

## Stop the Spark session
spark.stop()
```

In this example, the file `train_spark_model.py` demonstrates the process of training a Random Forest model using PySpark. Mock sales data is loaded from a CSV file, and various data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and model saving processes are showcased.
