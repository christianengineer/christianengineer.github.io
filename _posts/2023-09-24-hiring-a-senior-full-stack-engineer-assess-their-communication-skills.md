## Hiring a Senior Full Stack Engineer: How to Assess Their Communication Skills

As a hiring manager or technical recruiter, itâ€™s crucial to evaluate a candidate's communication skills during the interview process, especially when hiring for senior full stack engineering positions. Effective communication is vital for collaborating with team members, understanding project requirements, and conveying technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders. In this article, we will explore how you can assess a candidate's communication skills by asking them about their projects.

## Why Communication Skills Matter for Senior Full Stack Engineers

Senior full stack engineers play a pivotal role in a development team, serving as the bridge between multiple functions and stakeholders. They are responsible for understanding and interpreting project requirements, translating them into technical deliverables, and effectively communicating progress, challenges, and recommendations.

### Benefits of Strong Communication Skills:

- **Effective Collaboration**: Senior engineers need to work closely with other team members, such as product managers, designers, backend developers, and frontend developers. Strong communication skills facilitate collaboration and ensure smooth workflow integration.

- **Requirements Understanding**: The ability to gather and clarify requirements is critical for engineers. By communicating effectively, senior engineers can bridge the gap between customer expectations and technical implementation.

- **Technical Leadership**: Senior engineers often mentor junior team members and guide them through projects. Clear communication skills help in teaching complex concepts, providing valuable feedback, and fostering a positive learning environment.

## Assessing Communication Skills through Project Discussions

While evaluating a senior full stack engineer's communication skills, it's beneficial to assess their abilities not only to write clear code but also to discuss and explain their projects. Here are some strategies to effectively evaluate their communication skills through project discussions.

### 1. Ask about a recent project they worked on

By prompting the candidate to discuss their recent project, you gain insights into their ability to articulate complex ideas, explain technical details concisely, and discuss challenges and solutions. Pay attention to the following:

- **Clarity**: Are they able to communicate the project's purpose, goal, and functionality in a way that is understandable to a non-technical person?
- **Organization**: Do they present information in a well-structured manner, highlighting the key components, technologies, and decisions they made during the project?

- **Technical Depth**: Are they able to dive into technical details when necessary? Do they demonstrate a good understanding of the underlying principles and technologies?

### 2. Evaluate their ability to discuss trade-offs and decision-making

Technical projects often involve trade-offs, and engineers need to make decisions based on various factors such as performance, scalability, maintainability, and user experience. Engage the candidate in a discussion about trade-offs they made during their projects and evaluate:

- **Critical Thinking**: Can they explain the pros and cons of the choices they made? Do they demonstrate the ability to think critically and analyze different solutions?

- **Impact Consideration**: Do they consider the broader implications of their chosen approach? Can they explain how their decisions align with the project's requirements and constraints?

### 3. Assess their experience in cross-functional collaboration

Collaboration with other stakeholders (e.g., designers, product managers) is crucial for successful project delivery. While discussing their projects, assess the candidate's experience in cross-functional collaboration by:

- **Exploring Communication Channels**: Ask them how they communicate with team members and stakeholders. Do they use tools like project management software, documentation platforms, or version control systems to effectively collaborate with others?

- **Conflict Resolution**: Inquire about instances where they faced conflicts or disagreements and how they resolved them. Look for examples that demonstrate their ability to compromise, seek common ground, and prioritize team success.

- **Team Dynamics**: Evaluate their capacity to adapt and work with team members of varying technical backgrounds, ensuring concepts are communicated effectively to achieve project goals.

## Conclusion

Assessing a candidate's communication skills is crucial when hiring for senior full stack engineering positions. By asking about their projects, you can gain valuable insights into their ability to explain complex technical concepts, discuss trade-offs, and effectively collaborate with other stakeholders. Look for candidates who demonstrate clarity, organization, critical thinking, and the capacity to adapt to various team dynamics. These qualities will contribute to the success of the team and the overall project delivery.
