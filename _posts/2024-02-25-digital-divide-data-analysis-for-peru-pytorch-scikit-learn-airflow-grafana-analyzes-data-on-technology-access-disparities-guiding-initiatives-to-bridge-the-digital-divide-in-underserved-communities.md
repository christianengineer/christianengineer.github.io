```python
# File Path: models/train_model.py

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import joblib

# Load mock data (replace with actual data loading process)
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature1': np.random.rand(100),
    'Feature2': np.random.randint(0, 2, size=100),
    'Target': np.random.randint(0, 2, size=100)
})

# Split data into features and target
X = data[['Feature1', 'Feature2']]
y = data['Target']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define and train the model (Random Forest Classifier as an example)
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f'Model Accuracy: {accuracy}')

# Save the trained model
joblib.dump(model, 'models/scikit-learn/mock_model.pkl')
```

This Python script `train_model.py` trains a mock Scikit-Learn model using randomly generated data for the Digital Divide Data Analysis for Peru application. It loads mock data, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a Random Forest Classifier model, evaluates its accuracy, and finally saves the trained model as `mock_model.pkl` in the `models/scikit-learn` directory. 

You can replace the mock data loading process in the script with your actual data loading implementation to train the model on real data for analyzing technology access disparities and guiding initiatives to bridge the digital divide in underserved communities.

```python
# File Path: models/train_complex_model.py

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np

# Define a complex neural network model using PyTorch
class ComplexModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ComplexModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(2, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 32)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(32, 1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

# Load mock data (replace with actual data loading process)
X = torch.tensor(np.random.rand(100, 2).astype(np.float32))
y = torch.tensor(np.random.randint(0, 2, size=100).astype(np.float32)).view(-1, 1)

# Initialize the complex model
model = ComplexModel()

# Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Train the model
num_epochs = 50
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(X)
    loss = criterion(output, y)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    if (epoch+1) % 10 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item()}')

# Save the trained model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'models/pytorch/mock_complex_model.pth')
```

This Python script `train_complex_model.py` trains a complex neural network model using PyTorch with randomly generated mock data for the Digital Divide Data Analysis for Peru application. The script defines a complex neural network architecture, loads mock data, initializes the model, defines loss function and optimizer, trains the model, and saves the trained model as `mock_complex_model.pth` in the `models/pytorch` directory.

You can replace the mock data loading process in the script with your actual data loading implementation to train the model on real data for analyzing technology access disparities and guiding initiatives to bridge the digital divide in underserved communities.
