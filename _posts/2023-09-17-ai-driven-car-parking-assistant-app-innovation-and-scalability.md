# AI-Driven Car Parking Assistant App Repository

This repository is dedicated for the development of a state-of-the-art AI-Driven Car Parking Assistant app, envisioned to be a top-tier product in optimizing the handling, control, and management of car parking spaces in various settings - be it shopping malls, public spaces, or office premises.

## Project Description

The AI-Driven Car Parking Assistant App is a smart solution designed to address the challenge of inefficient parking space control. By leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI), this app optimizes parking space utilization and ensures smooth flow of traffic. This is achieved through capabilities such as real-time tracking of parking space availability, suggesting the closest available spots to drivers, and predicting future parking space availability.

## Project Goals

1. Development of a scalable, efficient and user-friendly car parking assistant app.
2. Implementation of AI algorithms for real-time tracking and prediction of parking spot availability.
3. Enhancement of customer experience by reducing parking time and hassle.
4. Initiation of an intelligent system that facilitates better management and utilization of parking spaces.

## Key Libraries and Technologies

### Data Handling and Analysis

1. **Pandas:** This Python library will be used for data manipulation and analysis. It offers data structures and operations for manipulating large, complex datasets.
2. **NumPy:** NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

### AI and Machine Learning

1. **Scikit-learn:** This machine learning library for Python will be employed for implementing various AI algorithms, assisting in tasks such as model fitting, data preprocessing, prediction, and more.
2. **TensorFlow:** TensorFlow is another key library that will be utilized, particularly for developing and training deep learning models to predict future parking space availability.

### Back-End Development

1. **Django:** A high-level Python Web framework that promotes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites.
2. **Flask:** A lightweight backend framework for Python, it is exceedingly useful for the scalable creation of web applications.

### Front-End Development

1. **ReactJS:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications.
2. **Redux:** A predictable state container for JavaScript apps that will be used in conjunction with ReactJS for efficient and consistent state management across the app.

### Database Management

1. **PostgreSQL:** An open-source object-relational database system, PostgreSQL is robust and capable of handling large user traffic with efficient data optimization.

### Scalability and Traffic Handling

1. **Docker:** A tool designed to ease the process of development, deployment, and running of applications by using containers. It allows the app to scale well with increasing load.
2. **Nginx:** An HTTP and reverse proxy server, Nginx would be used for efficient handling and balancing of incoming user traffic.

Through the synergistic use of these libraries and technologies, we strive to develop a cutting-edge AI-Driven Car Parking Assistant App that simplifies parking management and provides the optimal user experience.

# AI-Driven Car Parking Assistant App Repository - AI Logic File

The AI Logic for the AI-Driven Car Parking Assistant App can be found in the `ai/scripts/ai_logic.py` file within the project.

Here's a basic layout of the `ai_logic.py` file:

```python
AI-Driven-Car-Parking-Assistant-App/
└── app/
    └── ai/
        └── scripts/
            └── ai_logic.py
```

Below is a brief overview of the `ai_logic.py`:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# AI Logic for handling AI-Driven Car Parking Assistant App

# Load dataset
def load_data(file_path):
    data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    return data

# Preprocess Data
def preprocess_data(data):
    # Define preprocessing steps
    # Return preprocessed data
    return data

# Split Data into Training and Testing Sets
def split_data(data):
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.iloc[:, :-1], data.iloc[:, -1], test_size=0.2)
    return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test

# Define Model
def define_model():
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Dense(10, input_dim=8))
    model.add(Dense(1))
    model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

    return model

# Train Model
def train_model(model, X_train, y_train):
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=10)

# Evaluate Model
def evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test):
    prediction = model.predict(X_test)

    return mean_absolute_error(y_test, prediction)

# Main Execution Flow of Car Parking Assistant's AI Logic
def main():
    data = load_data('dataset.csv')
    data = preprocess_data(data)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = split_data(data)
    model = define_model()
    train_model(model, X_train, y_train)
    evaluation_result = evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test)

    print(f'Model Evaluation Result: {evaluation_result}')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

This `ai_logic.py` file includes functions to load, preprocess, and split the data, as well as define, train, and evaluate the AI model. While the code here indicates the utilization of a simple neural network, the AI model used in the actual project may involve more complex algorithms or approaches based on the given data and requirements.

The main execution flow starts from reading a dataset, preprocessing the data, splitting the data into training and testing sets, defining the model, training the model, and finally evaluating the model.
