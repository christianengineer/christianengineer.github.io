# AI Automated Radio Frequency Signal Analysis Repository

## Objectives
The primary objective of the AI Automated Radio Frequency Signal Analysis repository is to develop a scalable and data-intensive AI application for analyzing radio frequency signals in communication systems. The application will leverage machine learning techniques to automate the analysis process, enabling real-time and accurate detection, classification, and prediction of various RF signal patterns.

## System Design Strategies
To achieve the objectives, we will employ the following system design strategies:
- **Scalability**: The application will be designed to handle large volumes of RF signal data, making use of distributed computing and parallel processing to ensure scalability.
- **Modularity**: The system will be modular, allowing for easy integration of new signal analysis algorithms, data sources, and machine learning models.
- **Real-time Processing**: We will focus on building a system that can process and analyze RF signals in near real-time, providing actionable insights for communication system operators.

## Chosen Libraries
The following libraries and tools have been selected for the development of this repository:
- **PyTorch**: PyTorch will be used for building and training machine learning models for RF signal analysis. Its flexibility and support for GPU acceleration make it ideal for handling complex signal processing tasks.
- **Apache Beam**: Apache Beam will be utilized for building data processing pipelines that can handle large-scale data processing and analysis. Its support for parallel processing and its ability to run on various execution engines make it suitable for our data-intensive application.
- **Docker**: Docker will be used for containerizing the application, providing a consistent environment for running the system across different platforms and simplifying deployment and scaling.

By leveraging these libraries and tools, we aim to build a robust and efficient AI application for automated RF signal analysis in communication systems.

# MLOps Infrastructure for Automated Radio Frequency Signal Analysis

To support the development and deployment of the Automated Radio Frequency Signal Analysis application, a robust MLOps infrastructure is essential. The MLOps infrastructure will enable the seamless integration of machine learning models into the application, ensuring their scalability, reliability, and maintainability. Here's an overview of the key components of the MLOps infrastructure for this application:

## Version Control System (VCS)
We will utilize a version control system such as Git to manage the source code, including all the machine learning model code, data processing pipelines, and application code. This allows for collaboration, versioning, and tracking changes in the codebase.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
Implementing a CI/CD pipeline will enable automated testing, building, and deployment of the application and machine learning models. Whenever new code is pushed to the repository, the CI/CD pipeline can automatically build the application, run tests, and deploy it to the production environment.

## Model Registry and Management
A centralized model registry will be utilized to store and manage trained machine learning models. This allows for easy tracking of model versions, reusability, and integration into the application. Tools like MLflow or Kubeflow can be used for model tracking and management.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Utilizing Infrastructure as Code tools such as Terraform or AWS CloudFormation, we can define the infrastructure required for the application and machine learning models in a version-controlled manner. This makes it easier to provision and manage infrastructure resources consistently across different environments.

## Monitoring and Logging
Implementation of monitoring and logging tools will allow us to track the performance and behavior of the application and machine learning models in production. Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack can be used for real-time monitoring and log management.

## Container Orchestration
Deploying the application and its components in containers using Docker and orchestrating them with a tool like Kubernetes will provide scalability, resilience, and efficient resource utilization.

## Documentation and Collaboration
Utilizing documentation tools and collaborative platforms will facilitate knowledge sharing, onboarding, and best practice dissemination across the development and operations teams.

By building a comprehensive MLOps infrastructure incorporating these components, we can ensure the reliable and efficient deployment of the Automated Radio Frequency Signal Analysis application, integrating PyTorch, Apache Beam, and Docker, for communication systems. This approach will streamline the development, deployment, and maintenance of the application, enabling scalable, data-intensive, AI-driven analysis of RF signals.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a PyTorch model for Automated Radio Frequency Signal Analysis using mock data. This script assumes the availability of the PyTorch library and a mock data file named "rf_data.csv" in the "data" directory.

```python
# train_model.py

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import pandas as pd

# Load mock RF signal data
data_path = "data/rf_data.csv"
rf_data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

# Preprocess the data (e.g., normalization, feature engineering)
# ...

# Prepare input features and target labels
# ...

# Define the neural network model using PyTorch
class RFSignalClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super(RFSignalClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.softmax = nn.Softmax(dim=1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        x = self.softmax(x)
        return x

# Instantiate the model
input_dim = 10  # Example input dimension
hidden_dim = 5   # Example hidden dimension
output_dim = 2   # Example output dimension
model = RFSignalClassifier(input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim)

# Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Train the model with mock data
for epoch in range(100):
    inputs = torch.tensor(rf_data[['feature1', 'feature2', ...]])  # Example feature columns
    labels = torch.tensor(rf_data['label'])  # Example label column

    optimizer.zero_grad()

    # Forward pass
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

    # Backward pass and optimization
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    if (epoch+1) % 10 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/100], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')

# Save the trained model
model_path = "models/trained_model_mock.pt"
torch.save(model.state_dict(), model_path)
print(f"Trained model saved at {model_path}")
```

In this example, the script loads mock RF signal data from a CSV file, preprocesses the data, defines a simple neural network model using PyTorch, trains the model using the mock data, and saves the trained model to the "models/" directory as "trained_model_mock.pt".

The file path for the script is "automated_rf_signal_analysis/training/train_model.py".

This script can serve as a starting point for training a PyTorch model using mock data for the Automated Radio Frequency Signal Analysis application, integrating PyTorch, Apache Beam, and Docker for communication systems.

    optimizer.step()

    if epoch % 10 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')

# Evaluate the model on the test set
with torch.no_grad():
    test_inputs = torch.from_numpy(X_test).float()
