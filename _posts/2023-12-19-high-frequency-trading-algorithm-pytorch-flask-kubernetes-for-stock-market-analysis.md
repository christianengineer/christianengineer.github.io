```python
# File Path: high-frequency-trading-algorithm/app/ai_algorithm/train_model.py

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from models.lstm import LSTMModel
from utils import preprocess_data, split_train_test_data

# Load Mock Data
mock_data_path = "data/mock_stock_data.csv"
mock_data = pd.read_csv(mock_data_path)

# Preprocess Data
processed_data = preprocess_data(mock_data)

# Split Data into Training and Testing Sets
train_data, test_data = split_train_test_data(processed_data, train_ratio=0.8)

# Define LSTM Model
input_size = processed_data.shape[1]  # Number of input features
hidden_size = 64
output_size = 1
num_layers = 2
sequence_length = 10  # Sequence length for time-series data

lstm_model = LSTMModel(input_size, hidden_size, output_size, num_layers)

# Define Loss and Optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(lstm_model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Train the LSTM Model
num_epochs = 100
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for inputs, targets in train_data:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = lstm_model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item()}')

# Save trained model
model_save_path = "ai_algorithm/trained_models/lstm_model.pth"
torch.save(lstm_model.state_dict(), model_save_path)
print(f"Trained LSTM model saved at {model_save_path}")
```

In the file `train_model.py`, we start by loading mock stock data from the file path "data/mock_stock_data.csv". We then preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, and define an LSTM model using PyTorch. We use the defined LSTM model to train on the mock data, specifying the loss function (Mean Squared Error) and the optimizer (Adam). The trained LSTM model is then saved to a file path "ai_algorithm/trained_models/lstm_model.pth".

This file demonstrates the training process for an LSTM model using PyTorch and mock stock data, as part of the High-frequency Trading Algorithm application.

```python
# File Path: high-frequency-trading-algorithm/app/ai_algorithm/complex_ml_algorithm.py

import pandas as pd

# Load Mock Data
mock_data_path = "data/mock_stock_data.csv"
mock_data = pd.read_csv(mock_data_path)

# Implement Complex Machine Learning Algorithm
def complex_ml_algorithm(data):
    # Your complex machine learning algorithm implementation using PyTorch or other libraries
    # This may involve advanced feature engineering, model ensembling, or deep learning techniques tailored for high-frequency trading analysis.
    # Sample code for illustration:
    
    # Preprocessing
    # ... Your preprocessing code
    
    # Feature Engineering
    # ... Your feature engineering code
    
    # Model Training and Inference
    # ... Your model training and inference code
    
    # Return Trading Decisions
    trading_decisions = []  # Placeholder for trading decisions based on the complex ML algorithm
    return trading_decisions

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    trading_decisions = complex_ml_algorithm(mock_data)
    print(trading_decisions)
```

In the `complex_ml_algorithm.py` file, we start by loading mock stock data from the file path "data/mock_stock_data.csv". We then define the `complex_ml_algorithm` function, which represents a placeholder for implementing a complex machine learning algorithm tailored for high-frequency trading analysis. This algorithm may involve advanced feature engineering, model ensembling, or deep learning techniques using PyTorch or other machine learning libraries.

The `complex_ml_algorithm` function takes the input data, performs preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and inference to generate trading decisions based on the complex ML algorithm. These trading decisions are then returned.

The file also includes an example usage of the `complex_ml_algorithm` function by applying it to the loaded mock data and printing the resulting trading decisions.

This file serves as the foundational structure for implementing a sophisticated machine learning algorithm for the High-frequency Trading Algorithm application using PyTorch, Flask, and Kubernetes, leveraging mock data for illustration.
