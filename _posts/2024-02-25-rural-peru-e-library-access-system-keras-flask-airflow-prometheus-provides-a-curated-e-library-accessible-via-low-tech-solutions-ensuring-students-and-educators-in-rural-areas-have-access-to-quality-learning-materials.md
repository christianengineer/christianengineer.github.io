```python
## File: train_model.py
## Description: Training script for the machine learning model of the Rural Peru E-Library Access System using mock data

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

## Path to mock dataset for training
data_path = 'data/mock_data.csv'

## Load mock data
data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

## Preprocess data (if required)
## For example: data cleaning, feature engineering, etc.

## Define features and target variable
X = data.drop(columns=['target_column'])
y = data['target_column']

## Define and compile the neural network model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, input_dim=X.shape[1], activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

## Save the trained model
model.save('ml_models/trained_model.h5')
```

In this script (`train_model.py`), a neural network model is trained using mock data for the Rural Peru E-Library Access System. The model is built using Keras and is trained on the mock dataset stored in `data/mock_data.csv`. After preprocessing the data and defining the model architecture, the model is trained for 10 epochs, and the trained model is saved in the `ml_models/trained_model.h5` file.

Please ensure to replace `'data/mock_data.csv'` with the actual path to your mock dataset file, and customize the model architecture, training parameters, and data preprocessing steps based on the requirements of your specific machine learning model for the e-library system.

```python
## File: complex_ml_algorithm.py
## Description: Complex machine learning algorithm for the Rural Peru E-Library Access System using mock data

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import joblib

## Path to mock dataset for training
data_path = 'data/mock_data.csv'

## Load mock data
data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

## Preprocess data (if required)
## For example: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, etc.

## Define features and target variable
X = data.drop(columns=['target_column'])
y = data['target_column']

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Define and train the Random Forest classifier
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Make predictions on the test set
predictions = rf_model.predict(X_test)

## Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')

## Save the trained model
joblib.dump(rf_model, 'ml_models/complex_algorithm_model.pkl')
```

In this script (`complex_ml_algorithm.py`), a complex machine learning algorithm (Random Forest Classifier) is implemented for the Rural Peru E-Library Access System using mock data. The script loads the mock dataset from `data/mock_data.csv`, preprocesses the data, trains a Random Forest classifier on the training set, and evaluates the model's accuracy on the test set. The trained model is saved as `ml_models/complex_algorithm_model.pkl`.

Please customize the script with the appropriate data preprocessing steps, model hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics based on the requirements of the complex machine learning algorithm you intend to implement for the e-library system. Update the file path `'data/mock_data.csv'` to point to the actual location of your mock dataset.
