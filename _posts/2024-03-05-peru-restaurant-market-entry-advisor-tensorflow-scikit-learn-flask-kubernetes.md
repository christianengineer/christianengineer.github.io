- **Base Image:** Uses a Python 3.8 slim image as the base for the container.
- **Workdir:** Sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`.
- **Dependencies:** Installs the required Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- **Data and Model:** Copies the preprocessed data, trained model, and deployment script into the container.
- **Command:** Specifies the command to run the model deployment script (`deploy_model.py`) when the container starts.

### Instructions for Performance and Scalability:
1. **Optimized Image:** Use a slim base image to reduce the container size and improve performance.
2. **Caching Dependencies:** Use `--no-cache-dir` option when installing dependencies to speed up subsequent builds.
3. **Data and Model Handling:** Copy preprocessed data and trained model into the container for quick access during deployment.
4. **Efficient Deployment Script:** Optimize the deployment script (`deploy_model.py`) for fast execution and efficient model serving.

By following these instructions and utilizing the Dockerfile template provided, you can create a production-ready container setup that encapsulates your project's environment and dependencies, ensuring optimal performance and scalability for deploying the machine learning model in the *Machine Learning Peru Restaurant Market Entry Advisor* project.
