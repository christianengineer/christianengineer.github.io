# Smart Home Energy Optimization System Repository

## Description

The Smart Home Energy Optimization System is a highly sophisticated project managed by our company. Its primary function is to optimize the use of energy in a given household by effectively managing and coordinating various home appliances and systems. The project is designed to bring modern, advanced technological solutions to everyday home energy usage. By emphasizing on eco-friendly and cost-effective options, our system not only reduces the energy consumption of a typical household but also supports the global agenda of sustainability.

The repository of the system contains all the essential codes, scripts, and libraries required to smoothly run the system. It also includes a comprehensive documentation of the system architecture, data structuring, system functions, and system interfaces.

## Goals

1. **Performance Optimization:** Create an efficient, responsive and interactive system that can handle multiple inputs while optimizing outputs for energy consumption.
2. **Scalable:** Develop a system that can be easily scaled according to the number of devices in a household, supporting a wide range of home systems without compromising performance.
3. **Sustainability:** Optimize energy use to contribute to reduced carbon footprint and support global sustainability campaigns.
4. **Ease of Use:** Facilitate users to have complete control of their household devices in an easy and interactive way.
5. **Cost-Effective:** Design the system to be affordable for average household users, with a flexible pricing model based on usage.

## Libraries

Our system is designed using various libraries to sustain heavy user traffic and manage data efficiently. Below is a list of some libraries we use:

### Front-end Libraries

1. **React.js:** It's a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
2. **Redux.js:** This library is used for state container management in JavaScript applications.
3. **Material-UI:** It's a popular React UI framework for faster and easier web development.

### Back-end Libraries

1. **Node.js:** It's a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine, used for building fast and scalable network applications.
2. **Express.js:** It's a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

### Data Handling Libraries

1. **MongoDB:** It's a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program for NoSQL databases.
2. **Mongoose:** This library is used to connect to MongoDB and manage relationships between data.
3. **jsonwebtoken (JWT):** It's used for securely transmitting information as a JSON object.

### Traffic Handling Libraries

1. **LoadBalancing:** It's used to distribute network or application traffic across many servers.
2. **Redis:** It's an open-source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker.

The system's repository is continuously updated, maintained, and kept robust with the latest and most efficient libraries to ensure scalability, security, and efficiency, in line with our objectives.

# File Structure for Smart Home Energy Optimization System Repository

The structure for our repository serves as an ideal layout for our system, ensuring a modular and scalable full-stack codebase. It follows the standard industry practices and provides a clear view of project organization.

## Explanation of the key directories:

- **client/**: Contains all the React-based front-end code and assets.
- **server/**: Houses all the Node.js and Express-based back-end code.
- **test/**: Contains unit tests for both front-end and back-end. It's separated into two sub-directories: `client/` for React components testing and `server/` for server routes and database operations testing.
- **.env**: Sets environment variable for sensitive data such as database connection strings and API keys.
- **.gitignore**: Prevents specific files and directories such as `node_modules/` from being tracked by git.
- **README.md**: Provides necessary instructions, explanations and documentation for the repository.
- **LICENSE**: Defines the terms under which the project's codebase can be shared or used.
- **package.json**: Details out the project dependencies, scripts, and brief info about the project. There are separate `package.json` for both client and server side, adhering to their respective dependencies and scripts.

# EnergyOptimizationLogic.js

This file, `EnergyOptimizationLogic.js`, implements the core application logic for the Smart Home Energy Optimization System. It is responsible for determining how energy resources are distributed among various home appliances and systems.

• **Folder location:** `/server/controllers/EnergyOptimizationLogic.js`

```javascript

```

const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Appliance = mongoose.model('Appliance');

const getEnergyConsumptionPerAppliance = async (applianceID) => {
const appliance = await Appliance.findById(applianceID);
return appliance.energyConsumption;
};

const sortAppliancesByEnergyConsumption = async (appliances) => {
const sortedAppliances = appliances.sort((a, b) => {
return getEnergyConsumptionPerAppliance(a.\_id) - getEnergyConsumptionPerAppliance(b.\_id);
});

return sortedAppliances;
};

const distributeEnergy = async (availableEnergy) => {
const appliances = await Appliance.find();
const sortedAppliances = await sortAppliancesByEnergyConsumption(appliances);

let remainingEnergy = availableEnergy;

for (const appliance of sortedAppliances) {
if (remainingEnergy <= 0) {
appliance.isOn = false;
} else {
const applianceEnergyConsumption = await getEnergyConsumptionPerAppliance(appliance.\_id);

      if (remainingEnergy >= applianceEnergyConsumption) {
        remainingEnergy -= applianceEnergyConsumption;
        appliance.isOn = true;
      } else {
        appliance.isOn = false;
      }

      await appliance.save();
    }

}
};

module.exports = { distributeEnergy };

This script depends on the `mongoose` package and interfaces with our MongoDB database through the `Appliance` model. The file exports a `distributeEnergy` function that efficiently allocates an input quantity of energy across all appliances in the system.

The logic of energy distribution is as follows:

1. Retrieve all registered appliances from our MongoDB database.
2. Sort the appliances based on how much energy they consume (lowest first).
3. Subtract each appliance's energy consumption from the remaining available energy, toggling the `isOn` property as needed to distribute energy most efficiently.

With this logic, the system ensures that the lower-energy-yielding devices remain operational for a longer period of time, optimizing home energy usage.

The logic in this file is an essential core part of the Smart Home Energy Optimization system, facilitating an efficient energy distribution strategy to achieve sustainability and cost-effectiveness.
