Certainly! Below is a simple Python script for training a Keras-based model for the real-time medical emergency response system, using mock data for demonstration purposes. 

```python
## File Name: model_training.py
## File Path: /model_training_pipeline/model_training.py

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

## Load mock data (replace with actual data loading logic)
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_mock_data/emergency_cases_mock_data.csv')

## Preprocessing and feature extraction (replace with actual preprocessing logic)
X = data.drop(columns=['emergency_type'])
y = data['emergency_type']

## Define the Keras model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(12, input_dim=8, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(8, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

## Compile the model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=150, batch_size=10)

## Save the trained model
model.save('path_to_trained_models/emergency_classification_model.h5')
```

In the above script:
- The file name is `model_training.py`, and it is located within the `model_training_pipeline` directory.
- The script leverages mock data stored in a CSV file named `emergency_cases_mock_data.csv`, located in a directory specified by `path_to_mock_data`.
- The script demonstrates a basic Keras model training process using the mock data, including data loading, preprocessing, model definition, compilation, training, and saving the trained model in HDF5 format.
- The trained model is saved as `emergency_classification_model.h5` in a directory specified by `path_to_trained_models`.

Note that the actual implementation would involve real medical emergency data and a more comprehensive model training pipeline.

Certainly! Below is an example of a more complex machine learning algorithm using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with Keras for the real-time medical emergency response system. This script uses mock data for demonstration purposes.

```python
## File Name: emergency_classification_cnn.py
## File Path: /src/ai_models/emergency_classification_cnn.py

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

## Load and preprocess mock image data (replace with actual data loading and preprocessing logic)
## Assuming the data is stored in a directory containing images of medical cases
## Mock data loading and preprocessing to be replaced with actual data pipeline
X, y = load_and_preprocess_image_data('path_to_mock_image_data/')

## Define the CNN model architecture
model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), input_shape=(64, 64, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(units=128, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid'))

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

## Save the trained CNN model
model.save('path_to_trained_models/emergency_classification_cnn_model.h5')
```

In this script:

- The file name is `emergency_classification_cnn.py`, and it is located within the `ai_models` subdirectory.
- The script demonstrates the use of a CNN for classifying medical emergency images. It loads and preprocesses mock image data from a directory specified by `path_to_mock_image_data`.
- The defined CNN model consists of convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers for classification.
- The model is compiled, trained, and saved as `emergency_classification_cnn_model.h5` in a directory specified by `path_to_trained_models`.

This example highlights a more advanced machine learning algorithm using Keras, suitable for image classification tasks in the healthcare domain.
