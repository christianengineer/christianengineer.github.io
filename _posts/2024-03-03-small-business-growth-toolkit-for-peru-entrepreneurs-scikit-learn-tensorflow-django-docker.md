### Model Training Script for the Small Business Growth Toolkit

Here's a sample Python script for training a machine learning model in the Small Business Growth Toolkit for Peru Entrepreneurs using Scikit-Learn with mock data. This script demonstrates how to train a simple classifier for business stage classification.

```python
## train_model.py
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import joblib

## Load mock data (replace with actual data loading code)
data = {
    'revenue': [10000, 5000, 20000, 3000],
    'customer_base': [100, 50, 300, 30],
    'growth_rate': [0.1, 0.05, 0.15, 0.02],
    'business_stage': ['Startup', 'Established', 'Growth', 'Decline']
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

## Preprocess data (if needed) and split into X and y
X = df[['revenue', 'customer_base', 'growth_rate']]
y = df['business_stage']

## Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Initialize and train a Random Forest classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Evaluate the model
accuracy = clf.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Model Accuracy: {accuracy}')

## Save the trained model
joblib.dump(clf, 'models/scikit-learn/business_stage_classifier.pkl')
```

**File Path:** `scripts/train_model.py`

This script uses mock data to train a Random Forest classifier for predicting the business stage of small businesses. It preprocesses the data, splits it into training and testing sets, trains the model, evaluates its accuracy, and saves the trained model in the `models/scikit-learn/business_stage_classifier.pkl` file. Remember to replace the mock data loading code with your actual data loading logic for real-world application training.

### Complex Machine Learning Algorithm Script for the Small Business Growth Toolkit

Below is an example of a file that implements a complex machine learning algorithm using TensorFlow for the Small Business Growth Toolkit for Peru Entrepreneurs. This script trains a neural network model to predict growth opportunities for small businesses based on mock data.

```python
## train_neural_network.py
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

## Generate mock data
X = np.random.randn(100, 3)  ## Features: 100 samples, 3 features
y = np.random.randint(2, size=100)  ## Binary target variable for classification

## Define neural network architecture
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(3,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')

model.fit(X, y, epochs=50, batch_size=32)

## Save the trained model
model.save('models/tensorflow/growth_opportunity_predictor')
```

**File Path:** `scripts/train_neural_network.py`

This script generates mock data, defines a neural network model using TensorFlow, compiles the model, trains it on the mock data, and saves the trained neural network model in the `models/tensorflow/growth_opportunity_predictor` directory. Remember to replace the mock data with actual data relevant to the growth opportunities prediction task in a real-world scenario.
