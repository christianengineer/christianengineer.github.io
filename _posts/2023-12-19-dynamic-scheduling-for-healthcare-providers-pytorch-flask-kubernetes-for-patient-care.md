In this mock `model_training.py` file, we demonstrate the training of a PyTorch-based scheduling model using mock scheduling data. The file path for this script is `dynamic_scheduling_healthcare/src/machine_learning/model_training.py`.

The script performs the following key tasks:
1. Loads mock scheduling data from a CSV file.
2. Preprocesses the data by selecting relevant features, handling missing values, and performing feature scaling.
3. Defines a simple neural network model architecture using PyTorch's nn module.
4. Instantiates the model, defines the loss function (Mean Squared Error) and optimizer (Adam), and prepares the input and target data.
5. Trains the model for a specified number of epochs, updating the model parameters based on the training data.
6. Saves the trained model to a specified file path.

This script serves as a simplified representation of the model training process using PyTorch. In a real-world scenario, this script would be more comprehensive, incorporating data validation, hyperparameter tuning, and rigorous model evaluation.

```python
# File: complex_model_training.py
# Path: dynamic_scheduling_healthcare/src/machine_learning/complex_model_training.py

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load mock scheduling data
mock_scheduling_data_path = 'data/processed/mock_scheduling_data.csv'
scheduling_df = pd.read_csv(mock_scheduling_data_path)

# Feature and target selection
X = scheduling_df[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']].values
y = scheduling_df['target'].values

# Data preprocessing
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define and train a complex machine learning model (Random Forest for demonstration)
regr = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, max_depth=10, random_state=42)
regr.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
y_pred = regr.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')

# Save the trained model
model_save_path = 'models/trained_models/mock_complex_scheduling_model.pkl'
import joblib
joblib.dump(regr, model_save_path)
```

In this mock `complex_model_training.py` file, we demonstrate the training of a complex machine learning model using mock scheduling data. The file path for this script is `dynamic_scheduling_healthcare/src/machine_learning/complex_model_training.py`.

The script performs the following key tasks:
1. Loads mock scheduling data from a CSV file.
2. Selects relevant features and the target variable from the data.
3. Preprocesses the data through feature scaling and train-test split.
4. Defines and trains a complex machine learning model (Random Forest Regressor for demonstration).
5. Evaluates the model's performance using mean squared error.
6. Saves the trained model to a specified file path using joblib.

This script serves as a representative example of training a complex machine learning model using scikit-learn, which may be applicable in scenarios where non-neural network-based models are suitable for certain aspects of the Dynamic Scheduling for Healthcare Providers application. While PyTorch is not used in this specific example, such machine learning models are often part of a comprehensive AI system alongside neural network-based models.
