By following this step-by-step deployment plan and utilizing the recommended tools for each stage, the deployment of the machine learning model for the Personalized Health Advisory System can be carried out effectively, ensuring a seamless integration into the live production environment.

```Dockerfile
# Use a base TensorFlow image
FROM tensorflow/tensorflow:latest

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the necessary files into the container
COPY requirements.txt /app/
COPY health_advisory_model.h5 /app/

# Install required Python packages
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy the entry script into the container
COPY entry_script.sh /app/

# Set the entrypoint script
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash", "entry_script.sh"]
```

### Dockerfile Configurations:

1. **Base Image:** Utilizes the latest TensorFlow image as a base for compatibility with TensorFlow model deployment.
2. **Working Directory:** Sets the working directory within the container for organizing project files.
3. **Dependency Installation:** Installs necessary Python packages specified in `requirements.txt` for model deployment.
4. **Model Loading:** Copies the trained model `health_advisory_model.h5` into the container for inference.
5. **Entrypoint Setup:** Specifies the `entry_script.sh` as the entrypoint script for running the model.

### Performance and Scalability Considerations:
- **Optimized Base Image:** Leveraging the official TensorFlow image ensures optimized performance for TensorFlow model serving.
- **Dependency Management:** Installing required packages from `requirements.txt` streamlines environment setup for scalability.
- **Model Loading Efficiency:** Directly loading the trained model within the Docker container enhances performance by reducing I/O overhead.

### Note:
- Customize the Dockerfile further based on additional dependencies, environment configurations, and specific project requirements to optimize performance and scalability for the Personalized Health Advisory System.
