Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a regression model for the Water Quality Monitoring application using Scikit-Learn and Pandas. The script uses mock data for demonstration purposes.

File Path: `src/model_training/train_regression_model.py`

```python
## train_regression_model.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import joblib

## Load mock water quality data from a CSV file
data_path = 'data/processed/mock_water_quality_data.csv'
water_quality_data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

## Perform feature selection and split the data into features (X) and target variable (y)
X = water_quality_data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']]
y = water_quality_data['target']

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Initialize and train a linear regression model
regression_model = LinearRegression()
regression_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Evaluate the model
train_score = regression_model.score(X_train, y_train)
test_score = regression_model.score(X_test, y_test)

## Save the trained model to a file
model_output_path = 'models/training/regression_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(regression_model, model_output_path)

## Print the model evaluation metrics
print(f"Training R-squared score: {train_score}")
print(f"Testing R-squared score: {test_score}")
print(f"Trained regression model saved to: {model_output_path}")
```

In this example script, the mock water quality data is loaded from a CSV file, and a simple linear regression model is trained using Scikit-Learn. The trained model is then serialized using joblib and saved to a file. The script also prints the training and testing R-squared scores to evaluate the model's performance.

This script serves as an illustrative example for training a regression model using mock data for the Water Quality Monitoring application. Actual data and feature engineering specific to the water quality domain would be used in a real-world scenario.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a Random Forest classifier, a more complex machine learning algorithm, for the Water Quality Monitoring application using Scikit-Learn and Pandas. The script uses mock data for demonstration purposes.

File Path: `src/model_training/train_random_forest_classifier.py`

```python
## train_random_forest_classifier.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
import joblib

## Load mock water quality data from a CSV file
data_path = 'data/processed/mock_water_quality_data.csv'
water_quality_data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

## Perform feature selection and split the data into features (X) and target variable (y)
X = water_quality_data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']]
y = water_quality_data['label']  ## Assuming 'label' is the target class for classification

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Initialize and train a Random Forest classifier
classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)

## Evaluate the model
classification_summary = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

## Save the trained model to a file
model_output_path = 'models/training/random_forest_classifier.joblib'
joblib.dump(classifier, model_output_path)

## Print the classification report and the model path
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_summary)
print(f"Trained Random Forest Classifier saved to: {model_output_path}")
```

In this script, the mock water quality data is loaded from a CSV file, and a Random Forest classifier is trained using Scikit-Learn. The script illustrates the training process, making predictions on the test set, and evaluating the model using a classification report. The trained model is serialized using joblib and saved to a file.

This script demonstrates the training of a more complex machine learning algorithm, specifically a Random Forest classifier, using mock data for the Water Quality Monitoring application. Actual data and domain-specific features would be used in a real-world scenario.
