Certainly! Below is a Python function that implements a complex machine learning algorithm using mock data for anomaly detection in the RealTimeWatch application. The function demonstrates a simple example of an anomaly detection algorithm using isolation forest for detecting anomalies in time-series data. The function uses the `anomaly_data.csv` file, which contains mock data for demonstration purposes.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

def run_anomaly_detection(file_path):
    # Load mock data from the specified file
    data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

    # Feature engineering and data preprocessing (if needed)
    # ...

    # Model training
    model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.05)  # Contamination parameter can be adjusted
    model.fit(data)

    # Predict anomalies
    anomalies = model.predict(data)

    # Post-processing and visualization (if needed)
    # ...

    return anomalies
```

In this example:

- The `run_anomaly_detection` function takes a file path as input, representing the path to the `anomaly_data.csv` file containing the mock data.
- It loads the data, trains an isolation forest model for anomaly detection, and predicts anomalies in the data.
- Finally, it returns the detected anomalies for further processing or visualization.

The `anomaly_data.csv` file is assumed to contain the mock data for anomaly detection.

This function encapsulates the machine learning algorithm for anomaly detection and can be integrated into the RealTimeWatch application's AI module for real-time monitoring and anomaly detection tasks.

Certainly! Below is a Python function that implements a complex deep learning algorithm using mock data for anomaly detection in the RealTimeWatch application. This function demonstrates a simple example of a deep learning model for anomaly detection using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells. The function uses the `anomaly_data.csv` file, which contains mock data for demonstration purposes.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

def run_deep_learning_anomaly_detection(file_path):
    # Load mock data from the specified file
    data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

    # Data preprocessing and feature engineering (if needed)
    # ...

    # Define model architecture
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(LSTM(64, input_shape=(None, num_features), return_sequences=True))
    model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))

    # Predict anomalies
    anomalies_probabilities = model.predict(X_test)

    # Post-processing and visualization (if needed)
    # ...

    return anomalies_probabilities
```

In this example:

- The `run_deep_learning_anomaly_detection` function takes a file path as input, representing the path to the `anomaly_data.csv` file containing the mock data.
- It loads the data, constructs an LSTM-based deep learning model for anomaly detection, and trains the model on the data.
- The model then predicts anomaly probabilities for the data.
- Finally, it returns the anomaly probabilities for further processing or visualization.

The `anomaly_data.csv` file is assumed to contain the mock data for anomaly detection.

This function encapsulates the deep learning algorithm for anomaly detection and can be integrated into the RealTimeWatch application's AI module for real-time monitoring and anomaly detection tasks.
