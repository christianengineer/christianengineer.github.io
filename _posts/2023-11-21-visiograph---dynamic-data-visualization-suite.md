Sure, here's an example of a function for a complex machine learning algorithm using mock data. Let's consider a classification algorithm using a Random Forest Classifier from the scikit-learn library, applied to a dataset of mock customer data for predicting customer churn.

```python
# File: AI/machine_learning/customer_churn_prediction.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def customer_churn_prediction(mock_data_file_path):
    # Load mock customer data
    data = pd.read_csv(mock_data_file_path)

    # Preprocessing: assuming 'Churn' is the target variable and other columns are features
    X = data.drop('Churn', axis=1)
    y = data['Churn']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Instantiate the Random Forest Classifier
    clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

    # Train the model
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions
    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")

    return clf  # Returning the trained model for future predictions
```

In this example, the `customer_churn_prediction` function loads mock customer data from a CSV file specified by the `mock_data_file_path`. It then preprocesses the data, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a Random Forest Classifier, makes predictions, and evaluates the model's accuracy.

This function can be used within the VisioGraph application's machine learning module for predicting customer churn based on the provided dataset.

The file path for this function is `AI/machine_learning/customer_churn_prediction.py` within the repository's directory structure.

```python
# File: AI/deep_learning/image_classification.py

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def image_classification_with_deep_learning(mock_data_path):
    # Load mock image data and labels
    # Assuming the mock data contains images and corresponding labels
    # Replace this with actual code to load mock image data
    X, y = load_mock_image_data(mock_data_path)

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Define the deep learning model architecture
    model = Sequential([
        Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
        MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        Flatten(),
        Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # Assuming 10 classes for image classification
    ])

    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    return model  # Returning the trained deep learning model for future predictions

def load_mock_image_data(mock_data_path):
    # Replace this with actual code to load mock image data and corresponding labels
    # Example - load and preprocess mock image data from mock_data_path
    # Return loaded image data (X) and corresponding labels (y)
    # This is just a placeholder and should be replaced with actual data loading code
    X = np.random.rand(100, 64, 64, 3)  # Mock image data of shape (100, 64, 64, 3)
    y = np.random.randint(0, 10, 100)  # Mock labels (assuming 10 classes)

    return X, y
```

In this example, I've created a function called `image_classification_with_deep_learning` in the file `AI/deep_learning/image_classification.py` within the repository's directory structure. This function demonstrates the use of deep learning for image classification using mock data.

The function loads mock image data and corresponding labels, preprocesses the data, defines a deep learning model architecture using TensorFlow's Keras API, compiles the model, trains it, and returns the trained deep learning model for future predictions.

The `load_mock_image_data` function is a placeholder for loading and preprocessing mock image data and labels. It should be replaced with actual code to load real image data for training the deep learning model.

This function showcases a complex deep learning algorithm for image classification and can be used within the VisioGraph application for tasks such as image recognition and analysis.
