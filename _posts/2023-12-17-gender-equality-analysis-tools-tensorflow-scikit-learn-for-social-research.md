### Training Script for TensorFlow Model
**File Path:** `models/tensorflow/gender_classification/train.py`

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Generate mock data
num_samples = 1000
num_features = 5
num_classes = 2
X = np.random.rand(num_samples, num_features)
y = np.random.choice(num_classes, num_samples)

# Define a simple neural network model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(num_features,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Save the trained model
model.save('gender_classification_model')
```

### Training Script for Scikit-Learn Model
**File Path:** `models/scikit-learn/gender_analysis/train.py`

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import joblib

# Generate mock data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, random_state=42)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Instantiate and train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')

# Save the trained model
joblib.dump(model, 'gender_analysis_model.pkl')
```

In the provided example, the training scripts `train.py` for the TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn models create mock data, train the models, and save the trained models to disk. These scripts can serve as a starting point for training models once real data becomes available. 

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script that implements a more complex machine learning algorithm for the Gender Equality Analysis Tools. We'll create a script for a deep learning model using TensorFlow and a script for a complex model using Scikit-Learn, both trained on mock data.

num_samples = 1000
num_features = 10
num_classes = 2
X = np.random.rand(num_samples, num_features)
y = np.random.choice(num_classes, num_samples)

# Define a complex deep learning model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(num_features,)),
    layers.Dropout(0.2),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.2),
    layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=20, batch_size=32)

# Save the trained model
model.save('gender_classification_complex_model')
```

### Complex Machine Learning Algorithm Script for Scikit-Learn Model
**File Path:** `models/scikit-learn/gender_analysis/complex_model.py`

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import joblib

# Generate mock data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, random_state=42)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Instantiate a complex model (Random Forest Classifier with parameter tuning)
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=500, max_depth=10, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')

# Save the trained model
joblib.dump(model, 'gender_analysis_complex_model.pkl')
```

In the provided example, the scripts `complex_model.py` for the TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn models implement complex machine learning algorithms, generate mock data, train the models, and save the trained models to disk. These scripts illustrate the training process for more sophisticated models and can be further enhanced with real data.
