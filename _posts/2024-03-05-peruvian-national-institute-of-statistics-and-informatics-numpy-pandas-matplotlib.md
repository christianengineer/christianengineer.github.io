df = pd.DataFrame(np.concatenate([X, y.reshape(-1, 1)], axis=1), columns=columns)

# Add more relevant features based on the project's requirements
df['timestamp'] = pd.date_range(start='1/1/2021', periods=n_samples, freq='D')
df['category'] = np.random.choice(['A', 'B', 'C'], n_samples)
df['numerical_feature'] = np.random.rand(n_samples)
df['text_feature'] = ['Lorem ipsum']*n_samples
df['target'] = df['target'].astype(int)  # Convert target to integer

# Incorporate variability in the dataset to mimic real-world conditions
df.loc[df['target'] == 1, 'feature1'] += np.random.normal(0, 1, sum(df['target']==1))
