from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the raw data into a pandas DataFrame
data = pd.read_csv('real_estate_data.csv')

# Step 1: Handle Missing Values
# Replace missing values in numerical features with the median
data['property_size_sqft'].fillna(data['property_size_sqft'].median(), inplace=True)
data['num_bedrooms'].fillna(data['num_bedrooms'].median(), inplace=True)

# Step 2: Feature Engineering
# Create a new feature 'price_per_sqft' as a derived feature
data['price_per_sqft'] = data['property_price'] / data['property_size_sqft']

# Step 3: Encode Categorical Variables
# Implement one-hot encoding for 'property_type' column
data = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['property_type'])

# Step 4: Normalize Numerical Features
# Normalize numerical features like 'property_size_sqft' and 'price_per_sqft' using StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
data[['property_size_sqft', 'price_per_sqft']] = scaler.fit_transform(data[['property_size_sqft', 'price_per_sqft']])

# Step 5: Train-Test Split
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X = data.drop('property_price', axis=1)
y = data['property_price']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Deployment Steps Summary:
1. **Serialize Model**: Use `joblib` or `pickle` to save the trained model.
2. **Containerize Model**: Use Docker to create a container for the model.
3. **Develop API**: Use Flask to build a REST API for serving predictions.
4. **Deploy on Cloud**: Use AWS or GCP for scalable deployment.
5. **Monitor Model**: Use Prometheus for monitoring model performance.

By following this deployment plan and utilizing the recommended tools and platforms, the Exclusive Real Estate Investment Predictor model can be efficiently deployed into a live production environment, empowering the team to execute the deployment independently with confidence.

To create a production-ready Dockerfile tailored to the performance needs of the Exclusive Real Estate Investment Predictor project, optimizing for performance and scalability, follow the configuration below:

```docker
# Start with a base Python image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set a working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements file
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install necessary dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the preprocessed dataset and trained model
COPY preprocessed_data.csv .
COPY real_estate_investment_model.pkl .

# Copy the Flask app for serving predictions
COPY app.py .

# Expose the Flask port
EXPOSE 5000

# Run the Flask app
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

In this Dockerfile:
- We start with a slim Python 3.9 base image for reduced container size.
- We set a working directory at `/app` for the application.
- The `requirements.txt` file containing necessary Python packages is copied and installed.
- The preprocessed dataset (`preprocessed_data.csv`) and the trained model (`real_estate_investment_model.pkl`) are copied into the container.
- The Flask application script (`app.py`) for serving predictions is copied.
- Port 5000, where Flask runs, is exposed for external access.
- Finally, the Flask app is started as the container command when launched.

This Dockerfile encapsulates the project's environment and dependencies in a container, optimized for handling the performance and scalability needs of the Exclusive Real Estate Investment Predictor project. It ensures seamless deployment and execution of the Flask app serving model predictions in a production-ready environment.
