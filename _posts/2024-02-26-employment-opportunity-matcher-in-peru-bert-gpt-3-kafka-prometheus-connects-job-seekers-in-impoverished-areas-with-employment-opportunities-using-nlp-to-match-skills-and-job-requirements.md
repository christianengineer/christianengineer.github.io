I will provide a Python script file for training a BERT model for the Employment Opportunity Matcher in Peru, using mock data. This script will preprocess the data, train the BERT model, and save the trained model parameters. Below is the file content:

```python
# train_bert_model.py

import pandas as pd
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Load mock data for training
job_data = pd.read_csv('data/mock_job_data.csv')

# Preprocess data and tokenize job descriptions
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
tokenized_job_descriptions = tokenizer(job_data['job_description'].tolist(), padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')

# Define BERT model for sequence classification (matching)
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=2)

# Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./model_output',
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    save_steps=100,

)

# Define trainer for model training
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_job_descriptions
)

# Train the BERT model
trainer.train()

# Save the trained model
model.save_pretrained('./model_output')
```

### File Path:
The file `train_bert_model.py` should be saved in the `scripts/` directory within the project folder structure.
