```python
## File path: AI-assisted-Medical-Coding-Billing/models/billing_model/src/billing_model_training.py

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import pandas as pd

## Path to mock training data
training_data_path = '../../data/billing_training_data.csv'

## Load mock training data
training_data = pd.read_csv(training_data_path)

## Prepare input features and target variable
X = training_data.drop(['target_variable'], axis=1).values
y = training_data['target_variable'].values

## Define the billing model architecture using PyTorch
class BillingModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super(BillingModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

## Define model dimensions
input_dim = X.shape[1]
hidden_dim = 32
output_dim = 1  ## Assuming a regression task

## Instantiate the billing model
model = BillingModel(input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim)

## Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

## Convert input features and target variable to PyTorch tensors
X_tensor = torch.tensor(X, dtype=torch.float32)
y_tensor = torch.tensor(y, dtype=torch.float32).view(-1, 1)

## Train the billing model
num_epochs = 100
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(X_tensor)
    loss = criterion(output, y_tensor)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    if (epoch+1) % 10 == 0:

        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 32)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(32, output_dim)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.2)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))

        x = self.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.dropout(x)
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

## Define model dimensions

optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

## Convert input features and target variable to PyTorch tensors
X_train_tensor = torch.tensor(X_train, dtype=torch.float32)
y_train_tensor = torch.tensor(y_train, dtype=torch.float32).view(-1, 1)

## Train the coding model
num_epochs = 100
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(X_train_tensor)
    loss = criterion(output, y_train_tensor)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    if (epoch+1) % 10 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item()}')

## Save the trained model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'coding_model.pth')
```
