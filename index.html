                Hey, I'm Christian Ipanaque. I'm a Frontend Software Engineer
                living in Seattle, WA.
              </p>
              <p>
                It turns out solving 1,000s of bugs and issues with React
                applications has made me an expert in problem solving and
                debugging.
              </p>
              <p>
                The 100s of open source contributions on Github has made me
                fearless of unfamiliar code, and fix bugs no matter how
                difficult, challenging or hard-to-find the issue is.
