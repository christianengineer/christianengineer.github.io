Certainly! Assuming you have a machine learning algorithm for earthquake prediction, here's a Python function using mock data to represent the process of loading the dataset, training the model, and making predictions:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def earthquake_prediction_model(file_path):
    ## Load the mock seismic data from the given file path
    data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

    ## Preprocessing: Assuming the dataset contains features and labels
    X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = data['target']

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Initialize the Random Forest classifier
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    ## Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    ## Evaluate the model performance
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f'Model accuracy: {accuracy}')

    return model

## Example usage
file_path = 'path/to/mock_data.csv'
trained_model = earthquake_prediction_model(file_path)
```

In this function:

- The `earthquake_prediction_model` function takes a file path as input, representing the location of the mock seismic data file.
- It loads the data, preprocesses it, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a RandomForestClassifier model, makes predictions, evaluates the model's performance, and returns the trained model.

def train_earthquake_prediction_model(file_path):
    ## Load the mock seismic data from the given file path
    data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

    ## Perform feature engineering and preprocessing if needed
    ## ...

    ## Split the data into features and target variable
    X = data.drop(columns=['target_column'])
    y = data['target_column']

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    ## Evaluate model performance
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f'Model accuracy: {accuracy}')

    ## Optionally, you can save the trained model for later use
    ## model.save('trained_earthquake_model.pkl')

    return model

## Example usage
file_path = 'path_to_mock_data.csv'
trained_model = train_earthquake_prediction_model(file_path)
```

In this function:
