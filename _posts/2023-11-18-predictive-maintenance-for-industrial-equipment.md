## Technical Specifications Document - Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment

## Description

The Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment repository is a software system aimed at providing predictive maintenance capabilities for industrial equipment. The system will collect real-time data from various sensors, analyze it, and predict potential failures or maintenance needs. The overall goal is to optimize maintenance schedules, reduce downtime, and improve equipment reliability.

## Objectives

1. Efficient Data Management: Design a robust and scalable data management system capable of processing and storing large volumes of real-time sensor data efficiently.
2. High User Traffic Handling: Build a performant and scalable system that can handle a high volume of user traffic and provide real-time insights to users.

## Libraries and Technologies

To achieve the objectives, we will leverage the following libraries and technologies:

### Backend

1. Express.js: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js. Express.js will enable us to build a scalable backend that handles HTTP requests efficiently.
2. Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows running JavaScript code on the server-side. Node.js provides a non-blocking, event-driven architecture that will be beneficial for handling real-time data processing and communication.
3. MongoDB: A NoSQL database system that provides scalability, flexibility, and high-performance storage suitable for handling large volumes of sensor data. Its document-oriented model aligns well with the dynamic nature of sensor data.

Here is a breakdown of the recommended directory structure:

- `client`: Contains the frontend codebase.

  - `public`: Contains static assets like `index.html` and `favicon.ico`.
  - `src`: Contains the source code for the frontend.
    - `components`: Contains reusable UI components.
    - `pages`: Contains the different pages/screens of the application.
    - `services`: Contains services responsible for making API calls and interacting with the backend.
    - `store`: Contains actions, reducers, and the Redux store configuration.
    - `App.js`: Entry point for the frontend application.

  - `server.js`: Entry point for the backend application.
  - `package.json`: Manages the dependencies and scripts for the backend.

- Other top-level files: `.gitignore`, `README.md`, etc.

This file structure allows for a clear separation of concerns between the frontend and backend codebases. It organizes the code into logical modules and follows a modular approach, making it easier to maintain and scale the application over time.

Summary Section:

- The recommended file structure separates frontend and backend code into their respective directories (`client` and `server`).
- The frontend directory structure is organized into components, pages, services, and store, following a modular approach using React and Redux.
- The backend directory structure is organized into controllers, models, and routes, following the MVC pattern for handling API requests.
- Configuration files (`config.js`) and entry points (`App.js` and `server.js`) reside at appropriate locations.
- The top-level directory contains files like `.gitignore` and `README.md`.
- This file structure promotes scalability, maintainability, and code reusability.

File Path: `/server/controllers/predictiveMaintenanceController.js`

```javascript
// Import required libraries and modules
const SensorData = require("../models/sensorData");
const PredictionModel = require("../models/predictionModel");
const { makePrediction } = require("../utils/predictionUtils");

// Endpoint for receiving sensor data and making predictions
exports.receiveSensorData = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Extract sensor data from request body
    const { machineId, sensorId, value, timestamp } = req.body;

    // Save sensor data to the database
    const sensorData = new SensorData({
      machineId,
      sensorId,
      value,
      timestamp,
    });
    await sensorData.save();

    // Retrieve the latest prediction model
    const latestModel = await PredictionModel.findOne().sort({ createdAt: -1 });

    // Make prediction using the received sensor data and the latest model
    const prediction = makePrediction(sensorData, latestModel);

    // Return the prediction
    res.status(200).json({ prediction });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error in receiveSensorData:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: "Internal Server Error" });
  }
};
```

In this file (`predictiveMaintenanceController.js`), we handle the core logic for Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment. It receives sensor data from IoT devices, saves the data to the database, retrieves the latest prediction model, and makes predictions using the received sensor data and the model. The predicted result is then returned as a response.

This file resides in the `/server/controllers` directory of the project structure and is responsible for handling the incoming requests related to predictive maintenance.

File Path: `/server/utils/predictionUtils.js`

```javascript
// Import required libraries and modules
const PredictionModel = require("../models/predictionModel");

// Function to make a prediction using the received sensor data and the model
exports.makePrediction = (sensorData, model) => {
  // Implement the prediction logic here

  // Example implementation:
  const prediction = model.coefficient * sensorData.value + model.intercept;

  return prediction;
};
```

In this file (`predictionUtils.js`), we define the utility function `makePrediction` that is used to make predictions using the received sensor data and the model.

This file resides in the `/server/utils` directory of the project structure and is responsible for providing prediction functionality to the predictive maintenance controller (`predictiveMaintenanceController.js`).

To utilize this file, the `predictionUtils.js` file is imported into the `predictiveMaintenanceController.js` file using the statement `const { makePrediction } = require('../utils/predictionUtils');`. This integration allows the controller to utilize the `makePrediction` function for generating predictions based on the sensor data and the prediction model.

File Path: `/server/models/sensorData.js`

```javascript
// Import required libraries and modules
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

// Define the schema for sensor data
const sensorDataSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  machineId: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  sensorId: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  value: {
    type: Number,
    required: true,
  },
  timestamp: {
    type: Date,
    required: true,
  },
});

// Create and export the SensorData model
module.exports = mongoose.model("SensorData", sensorDataSchema);
```

In this file (`sensorData.js`), we define the schema and model for sensor data. This file plays a crucial role in the overall system as it enables the storage and retrieval of sensor data in the database.

The `sensorData.js` file is located in the `/server/models` directory and relies on the `mongoose` library for object modeling and interacting with MongoDB.

The interdependencies with previously outlined files are as follows:

- The `sensorData.js` model is utilized in the `predictiveMaintenanceController.js` controller where it is imported with `const SensorData = require('../models/sensorData');`. This allows the controller to create new instances of the `SensorData` model and save sensor data to the database.

The integration of the `sensorData.js` model with other files ensures proper data handling and storage, which is essential for the successful implementation of the predictive maintenance system.
