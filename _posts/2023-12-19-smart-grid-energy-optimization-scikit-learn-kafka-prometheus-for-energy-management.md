Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a machine learning model for the Smart Grid Energy Optimization application using mock data. This script utilizes Scikit-Learn for model training and leverages mock data for demonstration purposes.

### File: `model_training.py`

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import joblib

## Load mock training data
data_path = 'data/mock_training_data.csv'
mock_data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

## Data preprocessing and feature engineering
## ...

## Split data into training and testing sets
X = mock_data.drop('target_column', axis=1)
y = mock_data['target_column']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Model training
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Model evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')

## Save the trained model
model_path = 'models/trained_models/mock_energy_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, model_path)
print(f'Trained model saved at: {model_path}')
```

In this example, the script `model_training.py` loads mock training data from the file path `data/mock_training_data.csv`, preprocesses the data, trains a RandomForestRegressor model using Scikit-Learn, evaluates the model's performance, and then saves the trained model to the file path `models/trained_models/mock_energy_model.pkl`.

This script serves as a foundational step in training machine learning models for the Smart Grid Energy Optimization application, using mock data as a placeholder for real-world data. It sets the stage for advancing to real data pipelines and model training in the actual application environment.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a complex machine learning algorithm, specifically a gradient boosting algorithm, for the Smart Grid Energy Optimization application using mock data. This script utilizes Scikit-Learn for machine learning and mock data for demonstration purposes.

### File: `complex_model_training.py`

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import joblib

## Load mock training data
data_path = 'data/mock_training_data.csv'
mock_data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

## Data preprocessing and feature engineering
## ...

## Split data into training and testing sets
X = mock_data.drop('target_column', axis=1)
y = mock_data['target_column']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Model training using Gradient Boosting Regressor
model = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Model evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')

## Save the trained model
model_path = 'models/trained_models/complex_energy_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, model_path)
print(f'Trained model saved at: {model_path}')
```

In this example, the script `complex_model_training.py` loads mock training data from the file path `data/mock_training_data.csv`, preprocesses the data, trains a Gradient Boosting Regressor model using Scikit-Learn, evaluates the model's performance, and then saves the trained model to the file path `models/trained_models/complex_energy_model.pkl`.

This script demonstrates training a more complex machine learning algorithm, providing a foundation for experimenting with advanced modeling techniques in the Smart Grid Energy Optimization application. As before, this uses mock data for illustrative purposes and would need to be adapted to handle real-world data in a production environment.
