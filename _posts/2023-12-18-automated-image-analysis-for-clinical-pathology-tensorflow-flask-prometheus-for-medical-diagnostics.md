Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a model for the Automated Image Analysis for Clinical Pathology using mock data. This script demonstrates the training process and utilizes TensorFlow for building and training the machine learning model. The script is saved as `train_model.py` within the `models/training/` directory of the project.

```python
# models/training/train_model.py

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Mock data for training (replace with actual data loading code)
def load_mock_data():
    # Generate mock images and labels
    X_train = np.random.rand(100, 64, 64, 3)  # Mock images with shape (100, 64, 64, 3)
    y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(100,))  # Mock labels (binary classification)
    return X_train, y_train

# Define the model architecture
def build_model():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
        tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='binary_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load mock data
    X_train, y_train = load_mock_data()

    # Build the model
    model = build_model()

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

    # Save the trained model
    model.save('trained_models/mock_model')  # Save the trained model to models/trained_models/mock_model
```

In this script, the `load_mock_data` function generates mock images and labels for training. The `build_model` function defines a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) model using TensorFlow's Keras API. The script then trains the model using the mock data and saves the trained model to the `models/trained_models/mock_model` directory.

This script serves as a basic example for training a model using mock data. In a real-world scenario, you would replace the mock data with actual data loading code and customize the model architecture and training process based on the specific requirements of the Automated Image Analysis for Clinical Pathology application.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for a complex machine learning algorithm used in the Automated Image Analysis for Clinical Pathology application. The script demonstrates the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification, utilizing TensorFlow for model building and training. This script is saved as `complex_ml_algorithm.py` within the `models/training/` directory of the project.

```python
# models/training/complex_ml_algorithm.py

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Mock data for training (replace with actual data loading code)
def load_mock_data():
    # Generate mock images and labels
    X_train = np.random.rand(100, 128, 128, 3)  # Mock images with shape (100, 128, 128, 3)
    y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(100,))  # Mock labels (binary classification)
    return X_train, y_train

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Load mock data
    X_train, y_train = load_mock_data()

    # Define complex CNN architecture
    model = models.Sequential([
        # Convolutional layers
        layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(128, 128, 3)),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        # Dense layers
        layers.Flatten(),
        layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='binary_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

    # Save the trained model
    model.save('trained_models/complex_model')  # Save the trained model to models/trained_models/complex_model
```

In this script, the `load_mock_data` function generates mock images and labels for training. The script then defines a complex CNN architecture using TensorFlow's Keras API and trains the model using the mock data. Finally, the trained model is saved to the `models/trained_models/complex_model` directory.

This script serves as an example of a complex machine learning algorithm for image analysis, utilizing a CNN model architecture. In a real-world scenario, you would replace the mock data with actual data loading code and customize the model architecture based on the specific requirements of the Automated Image Analysis for Clinical Pathology application.
