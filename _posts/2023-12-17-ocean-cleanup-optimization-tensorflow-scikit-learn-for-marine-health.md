In the `models/` directory for the Ocean Cleanup Optimization application, there are two main subdirectories:

### 1. training/

This directory contains subdirectories for different types of trained models, focusing on marine debris image classification using TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn:

- **image_classification/**: Contains subdirectories for various image classification models.

  - **cnn_model/**: Directory for a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification.

    - **assets/**: Additional files or assets required for model serving.
    - **variables/**: Saved model variables.
    - **saved_model.pb**: The saved model file in Protocol Buffers format.

### 2. deployment/

This directory includes subdirectories for models optimized and prepared for deployment in production environments:

- **optimized_cnn_model/**: Contains the optimized CNN model ready for deployment.
- **resnet_model_v1/**: Includes the first version of the ResNet-based model prepared for deployment.

The organization of the `models/` directory ensures that trained models are structured and easily accessible for deployment. Each model is stored in a separate directory with its assets, variables, and saved model file, facilitating seamless deployment and serving within the Ocean Cleanup Optimization application.

## Deployment Directory for Ocean Cleanup Optimization

```plaintext

├── optimized_cnn_model/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── variables/
│   └── saved_model.pb
├── resnet_model_v1/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── variables/
│   └── saved_model.pb
└── ...
```

In the `deployment/` directory for the Ocean Cleanup Optimization application, there are subdirectories for the deployment-ready models:

### 1. optimized_cnn_model/

This directory contains the files necessary for deploying the optimized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which has been trained and fine-tuned for efficient inference in production:

- **assets/**: Additional files or assets required for model serving, such as vocabulary files or metadata.
- **variables/**: The directory containing saved model variables, including weights and biases.
- **saved_model.pb**: The saved model file in Protocol Buffers format, representing the trained model's architecture and parameters.

### 2. resnet_model_v1/

This directory includes the deployment files for the first version of the ResNet-based model, prepared for serving in production environments. Similarly, it contains the assets, variables, and the saved model file in Protocol Buffers format.

The `deployment/` directory encapsulates the deployment-ready versions of the trained models, each organized within its own directory to ensure clarity and separation of artifacts. These files are crucial for integrating the trained models into the production system, allowing for efficient and scalable deployment within the Ocean Cleanup Optimization application.

Sure, here's an example of a Python training script for a CNN model using TensorFlow for the Ocean Cleanup Optimization application. This will use mock data for illustration purposes.

### File: train_cnn.py

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import numpy as np

## Mock data - replace with actual data loading and preprocessing
## Example mock data for image classification
train_images = np.random.rand(100, 64, 64, 3)  ## 100 images of size 64x64 with 3 channels
train_labels = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=100)  ## Random binary labels for classification

## Define the CNN model architecture
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(2)  ## Output layer with 2 classes
])

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model using mock data
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10)

## Save the trained model
model.save('models/training/cnn_model')  ## Save the trained model to the specified path
```

#### File Path: `src/model_training/train_cnn.py`

In this example, the script defines a simple CNN model using TensorFlow's Keras API and conducts training with mock image data. After training, the trained model is saved to the 'models/training/cnn_model' directory within the project's file structure. This example script serves as a starting point for training a machine learning model and can be further extended with data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and validation steps.

Certainly! Here's an example of a Python script for a complex machine learning algorithm, Random Forest Classifier, implemented using Scikit-Learn for the Ocean Cleanup Optimization application with mock data.

### File: train_random_forest.py

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

## Mock data - replace with actual data loading and preprocessing
## Example mock data for marine health classification
features = np.random.rand(100, 10)  ## 100 samples with 10 features
labels = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=100)  ## Random binary labels for classification

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Initialize the Random Forest Classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

## Train the classifier
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Make predictions
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

## Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Test set accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

## Save the trained model - Not applicable for scikit-learn models
## Scikit-Learn models can be serialized using joblib or pickle if needed
```

#### File Path: `src/model_training/train_random_forest.py`

In this example, the script demonstrates the training of a Random Forest Classifier using Scikit-Learn. The model is trained with mock data representing marine health features and labels. The trained model is then evaluated using a test set.

Since Scikit-Learn models can be serialized using joblib or pickle, the saving of the trained model is not included in the script. Serialization can be performed if model persistence is required for deployment or future use.

This script forms a foundation for training and evaluating complex machine learning algorithms for the Ocean Cleanup Optimization application, with the potential for further refinement and integration into the larger project.
