Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a Scikit-Learn model using mock data within the Wildlife Conservation Analytics application. The example script, `train_scikit_learn_model.py`, demonstrates the process of training a simple RandomForestClassifier using synthetic data:

```python
# train_scikit_learn_model.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import joblib

# Mock data path
mock_data_path = 'data/processed/mock_wildlife_data.csv'

# Load mock data
data = pd.read_csv(mock_data_path)

# Prepare features and target
X = data.drop('target_column', axis=1)
y = data['target_column']

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Instantiate and train the model
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy}")

# Serialize the trained model
model_path = 'models/trained_models/scikit-learn/random_forest_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(rf_model, model_path)

print("Model training and serialization complete.")
```

In this example:
- The script reads mock data from a CSV file located at `data/processed/mock_wildlife_data.csv`.
- It trains a RandomForestClassifier model using the mock data and evaluates its accuracy.
- The trained model is serialized using joblib and saved at `models/trained_models/scikit-learn/random_forest_model.pkl`.

This script serves as a demonstration of model training using Scikit-Learn within the Wildlife Conservation Analytics application, with the ability to incorporate real wildlife and environmental data for sustained preservation efforts.

Certainly! Here's an example of a Python script for training a complex deep learning model using TensorFlow within the Wildlife Conservation Analytics application. The script, `train_tf_complex_model.py`, demonstrates the process of training a deep neural network for biodiversity preservation tasks using synthetic data:

```python
# train_tf_complex_model.py

import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import numpy as np

# Mock data path
mock_data_path = 'data/processed/mock_wildlife_data.npy'

# Load mock data
data = np.load(mock_data_path, allow_pickle=True)
X, y = data['features'], data['labels']

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Define the deep learning model architecture
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=X_train.shape[1:]),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Serialize the trained model
model_path = 'models/trained_models/tensorflow/complex_model/'
model.save(model_path)

print("Model training and serialization complete.")
```

In this example:
- The script loads mock data from a Numpy file located at `data/processed/mock_wildlife_data.npy`.
- It defines a deep learning model using TensorFlow's Keras API, comprising multiple dense layers with dropout for regularization.
- The model is compiled, trained, and evaluated using the mock data.
- The trained model is serialized and saved at the specified location `models/trained_models/tensorflow/complex_model/`.

This script showcases the training of a complex deep learning model using TensorFlow within the Wildlife Conservation Analytics application, laying the groundwork for leveraging advanced AI techniques in biodiversity preservation efforts.
