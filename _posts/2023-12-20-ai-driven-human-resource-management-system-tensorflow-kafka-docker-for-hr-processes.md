Each deployment directory contains the specific deployment-related files for the corresponding machine learning model, encapsulating the model serving logic and environment setup. These files enable the containerization and deployment of the trained models, providing a scalable and consistent approach to model deployment across different environments.

Additionally, the Dockerfiles facilitate the reproducibility and portability of the model serving setup, making it easier to deploy the models using containerization technologies. This structure ensures that the AI-driven HR Management System can effectively serve machine learning models for real-time predictions and inferences while maintaining scalability, reliability, and consistency across deployment environments.

Certainly! Below is an example of a file for training a machine learning model for the AI-driven Human Resource Management System using mock data. This file demonstrates the training process for a hypothetical candidate screening model using TensorFlow.

```python
## training/model_training.py

import tensorflow as tf
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from tensorflow.keras import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

## Load mock HR data for candidate screening
data = pd.read_csv('mock_candidate_data.csv')

## Preprocess the data
X = data.drop('target_label', axis=1)  ## Assuming 'target_label' is the label column
y = data['target_label']

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Build the candidate screening model
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

## Save the trained model
model.save('candidate_screening_model.h5')
```

In this example, the `model_training.py` script demonstrates the training process for the candidate screening model. The script loads mock HR data from a CSV file, preprocesses the data, builds a neural network model using TensorFlow's Keras API, compiles the model, trains it on the mock data, and saves the trained model to a file (`candidate_screening_model.h5`).

The mock data file path `mock_candidate_data.csv` should be in the same directory as the `model_training.py` script.

This file provides a simplified representation of the model training process for the AI-driven HR Management System. When integrating real data, it's essential to ensure that the data is processed and sanitized to maintain the privacy and integrity of sensitive HR information.

Sure! Below is an example of a Python file for a complex machine learning algorithm (XGBoost) for the AI-driven Human Resource Management System using mock data. In this example, we'll use XGBoost as the machine learning algorithm for employee performance prediction.

```python
## ml_models/employee_performance_prediction/model_training_xgboost.py

import pandas as pd
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

## Load mock HR data for employee performance prediction
data = pd.read_csv('mock_employee_performance_data.csv')

## Preprocess the data
X = data.drop('performance_category', axis=1)  ## Assuming 'performance_category' is the target column
y = data['performance_category']

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Define the XGBoost model
model = xgb.XGBClassifier(objective='multi:softmax', num_class=num_classes)

## Train the XGBoost model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

## Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print('Accuracy:', accuracy)

## Save the trained model
model.save_model('employee_performance_xgboost.model')
```

In this example, the file `model_training_xgboost.py` contains the training process for a complex XGBoost model for employee performance prediction. The script loads mock HR data from a CSV file, preprocesses the data, trains the XGBoost model, and saves the trained model to a file (`employee_performance_xgboost.model`).

The mock data file path `mock_employee_performance_data.csv` should be in the same directory as the `model_training_xgboost.py` script.

This file provides a simplified representation of a complex machine learning algorithm using XGBoost for the AI-driven HR Management System. When using real data, it's crucial to ensure that the data is processed and anonymized to protect the privacy of individuals and comply with data protection regulations. Additionally, the model should be thoroughly evaluated and fine-tuned based on real-world HR data to ensure its effectiveness in practice.
