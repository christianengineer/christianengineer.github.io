## <a name='overview'></a>1. Overview

Our master plan aims to design an AI-Powered resume analyzer platform that can handle large volume of data and high user traffic. It's critical to address both architectural and scalability aspects employing cutting-edge technologies and methodologies. By leveraging the power of Cloud computing we can ensure scalable operations resulting incandescent performance and robust user experience.

---

## <a name='architecture'></a>2. Architecture

We propose a microservices-based architecture hosted in the cloud, using an API-first approach.

```plantuml
@startuml
package "Resume Analyzer" {
  [User Interface]
  [API Gateway]
  [Resume Parser Service]
  [Scraping Service]
  [Machine Learning Service]
  [Data Storage Service]
}
cloud {
    [Resume Analyzer]
}

## <a name='cloud-integration'></a>4. Cloud Integration

A stateless design will be used, ensuring that the application can scale out according to demand. The system will be deployed on AWS utilizing services like Lambda for compute and S3 for storage.

---

## <a name='data-handling'></a>5. Data Handling

Our approach involves using a document-oriented NoSQL database like MongoDB Atlas, capable of handling large volumes of data at high speeds.

```javascript
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const resumeSchema = mongoose.Schema({
  _id: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  firstName: String,
  lastName: String,
  email: String,
  skills: [String],
  experience: [String],
});

module.exports = mongoose.model("Resume", resumeSchema);
```

---

## <a name='machine-learning'></a>6. Machine Learning Model

Training models efficiently demands high-performance computing power. By utilizing cloud-based GPUs like AWS EC2 P2/P3 instances and Google Cloud's AI Platform, we can accelerate this process.

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_dim=100))
model.add(Dense(units=10, activation='softmax'))
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer='sgd',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32)
```

---

## <a name='api-integration'></a>7. API Integration

To ensure optimal performance, asynchronous handling of requests will be used, preventing API blocking and ensuring smooth scaling under load.

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();

router.post("/resume", async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const data = await resumeService.parse(req.body);
    res.send(data);
  } catch (err) {
    next(err);
  }
});
```

---

## <a name='testing'></a>8. Testing

Incorporating both unit and integration testing, we protect the system from potential errors. Stress testing will be done to ensure scalability under high loads.

---

## <a name='phased-rollout'></a>9. Phased Roll-out

A phased roll-out strategy will be adapted to manage risks and improve sustainability, split into initial release, mid-release, and full release, with necessary scalability testing at each phase.
