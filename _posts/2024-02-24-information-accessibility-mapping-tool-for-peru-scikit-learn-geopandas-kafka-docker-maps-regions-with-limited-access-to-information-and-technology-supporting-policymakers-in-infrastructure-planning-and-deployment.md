I will provide a sample Python script `train_model.py` for training a machine learning model for the Information Accessibility Mapping Tool using Scikit-Learn with mock data. This script will load mock data, preprocess it, train a model, and save the trained model for deployment.

### File: `train_model.py`
```python
## Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import joblib

## File path for mock data
data_path = 'data/mock_data.csv'

## Load mock data
data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

## Data preprocessing and feature selection (mock implementation)
selected_features = ['population_density', 'internet_access', 'infra_quality']
X = data[selected_features]
y = data['limited_access_label']

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Initialize and train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Evaluate the model
train_accuracy = model.score(X_train, y_train)
test_accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)

print(f"Training Accuracy: {train_accuracy}")
print(f"Testing Accuracy: {test_accuracy}")

## Save the trained model
model_output_path = 'data/model_output/model.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, model_output_path)

print("Model training and saving completed.")
```

### File Path: `data/mock_data.csv`
You can create a mock data file `mock_data.csv` with sample data similar to the following:
```csv

100,1,3,0
150,0,2,1
200,1,4,0
250,1,3,0
300,0,2,1
```

In this script, we load mock data from `data/mock_data.csv`, preprocess the data, train a Random Forest model using selected features, evaluate the model, and save the trained model to `data/model_output/model.pkl` for deployment. 

You can execute this script to train a model for the Information Accessibility Mapping Tool using the provided mock data.

I will provide a sample Python script `complex_model.py` for implementing a more complex machine learning algorithm (Gradient Boosting Classifier) for the Information Accessibility Mapping Tool using Scikit-Learn with mock data.

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import joblib

## File path for mock data
data_path = 'data/mock_data.csv'

## Load mock data
data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

## Data preprocessing and feature selection (mock implementation)
selected_features = ['population_density', 'internet_access', 'infra_quality']
X = data[selected_features]
y = data['limited_access_label']

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Initialize and train the model (Gradient Boosting Classifier)
model = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Predict on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

## Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy}")

## Save the trained model
model_output_path = 'data/model_output/complex_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, model_output_path)

print("Complex model training and saving completed.")
```

### File Path: `data/mock_data.csv`
You can use the same sample mock data file (`mock_data.csv`) provided in the previous response.

In this script, we load mock data from `data/mock_data.csv`, preprocess the data, train a Gradient Boosting Classifier using selected features, evaluate the model, and save the trained model to `data/model_output/complex_model.pkl` for deployment.
