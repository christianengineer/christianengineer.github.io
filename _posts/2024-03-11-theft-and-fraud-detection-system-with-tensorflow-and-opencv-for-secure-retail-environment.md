By strategically employing these data preprocessing practices to address noise, imbalanced data, missing values, and other challenges specific to the project, you can ensure that the data remains robust, reliable, and conducive to training high-performing machine learning models for effective theft and fraud detection in the secure retail environment.

Here is a Python code file outlining the necessary preprocessing steps tailored to your project's specific needs for theft and fraud detection in a retail environment using AI integration with TensorFlow and OpenCV. Each preprocessing step is accompanied by comments explaining its importance.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from imblearn.over_sampling import RandomOverSampler

# Load and preprocess the data
data = pd.read_csv('surveillance_data.csv')

# Step 1: Handle Missing Values
data.fillna(0, inplace=True)  # Replace missing values with 0s

# Step 2: Feature Scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_features = scaler.fit_transform(data.drop('label', axis=1))
data_scaled = pd.DataFrame(scaled_features, columns=data.columns[:-1])

# Step 3: Address Class Imbalance
X = data_scaled.drop('label', axis=1)
y = data['label']
oversampler = RandomOverSampler()
X_resampled, y_resampled = oversampler.fit_resample(X, y)

# Step 4: Train-Test Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_resampled, y_resampled, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Save preprocessed data for model training
X_train.to_csv('X_train.csv', index=False)
X_test.to_csv('X_test.csv', index=False)
y_train.to_csv('y_train.csv', index=False)
y_test.to_csv('y_test.csv', index=False)
```

In this code file:
