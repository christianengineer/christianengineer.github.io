# How I Avoided Misunderstandings In My Technical Discussions By Using Clear, Concise And Direct Writing.

Communicating my thoughts and technical decisions have been understood more quickly because of the following writing patterns I use in my sentences.

1. X because Y.
2. Since X, Y.
3. If X, then Y.
4. Although X, Y.
5. X and/but/so Y.

X = Subject

Y = Verb

These patterns helped break up my sentences so that they're quicker to digest and understand. They also reduced confusion and misinterpretations within my team during high stake discussions.

## 1. X because Y:

### After

### Before
