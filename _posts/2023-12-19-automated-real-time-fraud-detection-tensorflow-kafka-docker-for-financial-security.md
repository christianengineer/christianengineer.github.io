Certainly! Below is an example of a file for training a model for the Automated Real-time Fraud Detection application using mock data. This script demonstrates how to load mock transaction data, preprocess the data, train a fraud detection model using TensorFlow, and save the trained model to a file.

```python
# File: ml_models/train_model_mock_data.py
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

# Load mock transaction data (example)
mock_data_file = 'data/mock_transaction_data.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(mock_data_file)

# Preprocessing
features = data.drop('label', axis=1)
labels = data['label']

scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_features = scaler.fit_transform(features)

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(scaled_features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define and train a simple fraud detection model using TensorFlow
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Evaluate the trained model
y_pred = (model.predict(X_test) > 0.5).astype("int32")

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}, Precision: {precision:.4f}, Recall: {recall:.4f}, F1 Score: {f1:.4f}")

# Save the trained model

model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=10, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the trained model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}, Precision: {precision:.4f}, Recall: {recall:.4f}, F1 Score: {f1:.4f}")
