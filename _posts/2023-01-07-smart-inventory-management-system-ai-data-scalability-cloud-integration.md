We're going to create an AI-driven inventory management system that dynamically allocates space based on predictive demand to maximize storage efficiency in warehouse operations. The target variable name for our model should be "Optimal Space Allocation Efficiency (OSAE)."

## Importance of Target Variable

The target variable "Optimal Space Allocation Efficiency" is crucial for this project as it encapsulates the core objective of dynamically allocating warehouse space to meet demand predictions efficiently. By optimizing space allocation, the system can minimize wasted space and maximize the utilization of available storage capacity, leading to significant cost savings and increased operational efficiency.

## Example Values and Decision-Making

For example, if the OSAE value is 85%, it indicates that the system is effectively utilizing 85% of the available warehouse space, leaving only 15% unused. In this scenario, the warehouse operations director can make decisions to further optimize space allocation by rearranging inventory or adjusting storage configurations to reach closer to 100% efficiency.

Conversely, if the OSAE value is only 60%, it suggests that there is significant wastage of warehouse space, leading to inefficiencies in storage utilization. In this case, the director can identify underutilized areas and rearrange inventory, implement automated storage systems, or adjust inventory levels to improve space efficiency and enhance overall warehouse productivity.

Having a clear target variable like OSAE enables the warehouse operations director to track performance, identify inefficiencies, make data-driven decisions, and continuously optimize space allocation strategies to meet dynamic demand patterns effectively.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Create fictitious mocked data
data = {
    'Inventory_Level': [100, 120, 80, 90, 110],
    'Demand_Forecast': [90, 110, 85, 100, 95],
    'Space_Utilization': [70, 65, 75, 60, 80],
    'Supplier_Lead_Time': [3, 2, 4, 3, 2],
    'OSAE': [85, 90, 80, 75, 95]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Define input features (X) and target variable (y)
X = df.drop('OSAE', axis=1)
y = df['OSAE']

# Split data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train Random Forest Regressor model
model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the target variable for the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model's performance using Mean Squared Error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

print("Predicted OSAE values for the test set:")
print(y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
```

In this Python script, the fictitious mocked data includes input features such as Inventory Level, Demand Forecast, Space Utilization, and Supplier Lead Time, along with the target variable OSAE (Optimal Space Allocation Efficiency). The script splits the data into training and test sets, trains a Random Forest Regressor model on the training data, predicts the OSAE values for the test set, and evaluates the model's performance using the Mean Squared Error metric. The predicted OSAE values for the test set are printed along with the Mean Squared Error.

## Secondary Target Variable: "Warehouse Turnover Rate (WTR)"

The secondary target variable, Warehouse Turnover Rate (WTR), could play a crucial role in enhancing our predictive model's accuracy and insights. WTR represents the rate at which inventory is replaced or sold over a specific period, reflecting the efficiency of inventory management and turnover in the warehouse. By optimizing both OSAE (Primary Target Variable) and WTR, the model can achieve groundbreaking results in warehouse operations by balancing storage efficiency with inventory turnover speed.

### Complementing OSAE with WTR

- **Example Values:**

  - OSAE: 85%
  - WTR: 4 times per month

- **Decision Making:**

  - If OSAE is high (e.g., 90%) but WTR is low (e.g., 2 times per month), it indicates that inventory is not moving fast enough despite efficient space utilization. In this case, the user can adjust inventory replenishment strategies to align with demand and improve turnover rates.

  - Conversely, if OSAE is low (e.g., 70%) and WTR is high (e.g., 6 times per month), it suggests a high turnover rate but inefficient space allocation. The user can reorganize storage configurations or prioritize fast-moving items to enhance space efficiency without compromising turnover speed.

### Achieving Groundbreaking Results in Warehouse Operations

By incorporating both primary target variable OSAE and secondary target variable WTR, the predictive model can offer a comprehensive optimization approach that balances storage efficiency and inventory turnover. This approach enables warehouse operations directors to make strategic decisions that maximize both storage capacity utilization and inventory movement speed, ultimately driving significant improvements in operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness in the warehouse domain.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Create fictitious mocked data
data = {
    'Inventory_Level': [100, 120, 80, 90, 110],
    'Demand_Forecast': [90, 110, 85, 100, 95],
    'Space_Utilization': [70, 65, 75, 60, 80],
    'Supplier_Lead_Time': [3, 2, 4, 3, 2],
    'OSAE': [85, 90, 80, 75, 95],
    'Warehouse_Turnover_Rate': [4, 3, 5, 4, 6]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Define input features (X) and target variables (y)
X = df.drop(['OSAE', 'Warehouse_Turnover_Rate'], axis=1)
y_osae = df['OSAE']
y_wtr = df['Warehouse_Turnover_Rate']

# Split data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_osae_train, y_osae_test, y_wtr_train, y_wtr_test = train_test_split(X, y_osae, y_wtr, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train Random Forest Regressor model for OSAE prediction
model_osae = RandomForestRegressor()
model_osae.fit(X_train, y_osae_train)

# Predict OSAE values for the test set
y_osae_pred = model_osae.predict(X_test)

# Train Random Forest Regressor model for WTR prediction
model_wtr = RandomForestRegressor()
model_wtr.fit(X_train, y_wtr_train)

# Predict WTR values for the test set
y_wtr_pred = model_wtr.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model's performance for OSAE prediction using Mean Squared Error
mse_osae = mean_squared_error(y_osae_test, y_osae_pred)

# Evaluate the model's performance for WTR prediction using Mean Squared Error
mse_wtr = mean_squared_error(y_wtr_test, y_wtr_pred)

print("Predicted OSAE values for the test set:")
print(y_osae_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error for OSAE: {mse_osae}")

print("Predicted WTR values for the test set:")
print(y_wtr_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error for WTR: {mse_wtr}")
```

In this Python script, fictitious mocked data with input features and target variables for OSAE (Optimal Space Allocation Efficiency) and WTR (Warehouse Turnover Rate) is used. The script trains two separate Random Forest Regressor models for predicting OSAE and WTR, respectively. It then prints the predicted values of both target variables for the test set and evaluates the models' performance using Mean Squared Error for each target variable.

## Third Target Variable: "Order Processing Time (OPT)"

The third target variable, Order Processing Time (OPT), could play a critical role in enhancing our predictive model's accuracy and insights. OPT represents the time taken to process and fulfill an order from the moment it is received, reflecting the efficiency of order fulfillment operations in the warehouse. By optimizing OSAE, WTR, and OPT, the model can achieve groundbreaking results in warehouse operations by balancing storage efficiency, inventory turnover, and order processing speed.

### Complementing OSAE and WTR with OPT

- **Example Values:**

  - OSAE: 85%
  - WTR: 4 times per month
  - OPT: 2 days

- **Decision Making:**

  - A scenario where OSAE is high, WTR is optimal, but OPT is prolonged indicates a bottleneck in order processing operations. The user can streamline order processing workflows, automate tasks, or adjust staffing levels to reduce processing times without compromising space efficiency or turnover rates.

  - Conversely, if OSAE and WTR are both low, but OPT is fast, it suggests that orders are processed efficiently, but there are inefficiencies in storage or inventory management. In this case, the user can focus on optimizing space allocation and inventory turnover strategies to improve overall warehouse performance.

### Achieving Groundbreaking Results in Warehouse Operations

By incorporating OSAE, WTR, and OPT as target variables, the predictive model can provide a comprehensive view of warehouse operations' efficiency, from space utilization to order fulfillment speed. This holistic approach allows warehouse operators to make data-driven decisions that optimize storage capacity, inventory turnover, and order processing efficiency, leading to significant improvements in overall operational performance and customer satisfaction in the warehouse domain.

    'Warehouse_Turnover_Rate': [4, 3, 5, 4, 6],
    'Order_Processing_Time': [2, 1, 3, 2, 2]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Define input features (X) and target variables (y)
X = df.drop(['OSAE', 'Warehouse_Turnover_Rate', 'Order_Processing_Time'], axis=1)
y_osae = df['OSAE']
y_wtr = df['Warehouse_Turnover_Rate']
y_opt = df['Order_Processing_Time']

# Split data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_osae_train, y_osae_test, y_wtr_train, y_wtr_test, y_opt_train, y_opt_test = train_test_split(X, y_osae, y_wtr, y_opt, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train Random Forest Regressor models for OSAE, WTR, and OPT
model_osae = RandomForestRegressor()
model_osae.fit(X_train, y_osae_train)

model_wtr = RandomForestRegressor()
model_wtr.fit(X_train, y_wtr_train)

model_opt = RandomForestRegressor()
model_opt.fit(X_train, y_opt_train)

# Predict values for the test set
y_osae_pred = model_osae.predict(X_test)
y_wtr_pred = model_wtr.predict(X_test)
y_opt_pred = model_opt.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the models' performance using Mean Squared Error
mse_osae = mean_squared_error(y_osae_test, y_osae_pred)
mse_wtr = mean_squared_error(y_wtr_test, y_wtr_pred)
mse_opt = mean_squared_error(y_opt_test, y_opt_pred)

print("Predicted OSAE values for the test set:")
print(y_osae_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error for OSAE: {mse_osae}")

print("Predicted WTR values for the test set:")
print(y_wtr_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error for WTR: {mse_wtr}")

print("Predicted OPT values for the test set:")
print(y_opt_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error for OPT: {mse_opt}")
```

In this Python script, fictitious mocked data with input features and target variables for OSAE, WTR, and OPT is used. The script trains separate Random Forest Regressor models for predicting each target variable and prints the predicted values for the test set. Mean Squared Error is calculated for each target variable to evaluate the models' performance.
