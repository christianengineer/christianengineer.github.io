## Intelligent Document Classification System Repository

### Description:

The Intelligent Document Classification System Repository is a comprehensive source to develop, test, and implement advanced AI-powered document classification algorithms and tools. This software solution is designed to automate the tedious task of manual document classification by using machine learning and natural language processing techniques.

### Goals:

Our primary goals for this repo include:

1. **Automation of Document Sorting:** To drastically increase the efficiency of document management and storage by reducing manual labor and errors.

2. **Use of AI and ML Models:** To leverage the benefits of smart algorithms in accurately identifying, categorizing, and classifying vast arrays of documents.

3. **System Scalability:** To ensure our system can handle a large amount of data without performance degradation, effectively dealing with an ever-increasing amount of information.

4. **User-friendliness:** To design an interactive user interface with intuitive design for easy use by tech and non-tech staff alike.

5. **Security and Integrity:** To uphold security standards to safeguard sensitive information from malicious third-party attacks and ensure the integrity of classified document information.

### Libraries and Tools:

To ensure efficient data handling and scalable user traffic, the following libraries and tools will be used:

1. **Python:** As a versatile, high-level language, Python will be the primary programming language due to its readability, ease of use, and compatibility with AI/ML libraries.

2. **TensorFlow & Keras:** TensorFlow will provide the ML backbone for our intelligent functionality. Keras, as a user-friendly neural network library written in Python, will be used alongside TensorFlow to process data and build the ML models.

3. **FastAPI:** One of the fastest web frameworks for Python, FastAPI will provide an effective way to build APIs, allowing the system to handle a large number of requests per second for high performance and scalability.

4. **Scikit-Learn:** As a free software machine learning library for Python, it will help in efficient data mining and data analysis, a vital part of the project.

5. **Pandas & NumPy:** These libraries in Python will help in efficient handling and manipulation of data.

6. **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** This platform used for building Python programs to work with human language data will aid in classifying documents.

7. **Docker & Kubernetes:** These tools will ensure that our application is properly packaged and managed, facilitating scaling and deployment.

By integrating the above-mentioned tools and libraries, we aim to create an Intelligent Document Classification System Repository that is versatile, efficient, and scalable to support vast document classifications in a seamless manner.

### Key Directories explained

- **`/src`**: This is the main source directory where all the Python code will live.

- **`/app`**: Within app, this is where we define all our application code. It further includes `/main` for the major functionalities, `/models` for defining classification models, and `/services` for actual document classifiers.

- **`/tests`**: This contains all the unit and integration tests.

- **`/config`**: This is where environment-specific settings reside.

- **`/data`**: This is where we store or training and testing datasets.

- **`/docker`**: Contains Dockerfile(s) used for containerization of the application.

`requirements.txt`: Contains pip dependencies which can be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

`README.md`: Provides a high-level overview of the project, instructions for setting up the development environment, and how to contribute to the project.

`.gitignore`: Specifies which files to ignore when making commits to the Git repository.

`Dockerfile`: Contains docker commands to build an image for the current application.

`docker-compose.yml`: Used to define and run multi-container Docker applications.

The file that will handle the logic for Intelligent Document Classification System could be `document_classifier.py`, which resides in the `/src/app/services` directory. Here's a simple high-level implementation of this file:

        self.model = None

    def preprocess_data(self):
        # Extract features and labels
        features = self.df['text']
        labels = self.df['class']

        # Train test split
        features_train, features_test, labels_train, labels_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size = 0.2)

        return features_train, features_test, labels_train, labels_test

    def train_classifier(self):
        # Training
        features_train, features_test, labels_train, labels_test = self.preprocess_data()

        # Text processing and classifier pipeline
        self.model = Pipeline([
            ('vect', TfidfVectorizer()),
            ('clf', SGDClassifier()),
        ])

        self.model.fit(features_train, labels_train)

    def classify_document(self, document):
        # Classification
        if self.model is not None:
            predicted_class = self.model.predict([document])
            return predicted_class

        return None
```markdown
This file `document_classifier.py` handles the main logic of the Intelligent Document Classification System. It contains the `DocumentClassifier` class, responsible for preprocessing the document data, training the classifier, and performing the actual classification of documents.

Please note that this is a simplified version. Optimized preprocessing methods, model selection, and parameter tuning should be performed to achieve higher accuracy in a real-world application. Additionally, the model should be saved after training to be reused for predictions without the need for retraining.
