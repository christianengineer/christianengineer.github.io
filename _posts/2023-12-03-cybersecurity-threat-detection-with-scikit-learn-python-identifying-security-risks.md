Certainly! Below is an example of a function for a complex machine learning algorithm using Scikit-Learn in the context of the Cybersecurity Threat Detection application. The example function demonstrates the training of a Random Forest Classifier using mock data and saves the trained model to a file path.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import joblib

def train_random_forest_model(data_path, model_save_path):
    # Load data from the specified path
    data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

    # Assume the data has been preprocessed and contains features and target labels
    X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = data['target']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize a Random Forest Classifier
    clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

    # Train the model
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Evaluate the model
    accuracy = clf.score(X_test, y_test)
    print(f'Model accuracy: {accuracy}')

    # Save the trained model to the specified file path
    joblib.dump(clf, model_save_path)
    print(f'Trained model saved to: {model_save_path}')
```

In this example:
- The function `train_random_forest_model` takes two parameters: `data_path` for the file path of the mock data, and `model_save_path` for the desired file path to save the trained model.
- The function assumes the mock data is in a CSV format and contains features and a target label.
- It uses a Random Forest Classifier from Scikit-Learn to train the model on the data.
- After training, the model is evaluated on a test set, and the accuracy is printed.
- Finally, the trained model is saved to the specified file path using the joblib library.

You can use this function by providing the file path to your mock data and the desired location for saving the trained model. For example:
```python
train_random_forest_model(data_path='path_to_mock_data.csv', model_save_path='trained_models/random_forest_model.pkl')
```
Ensure to replace `'path_to_mock_data.csv'` with the actual file path of your mock data and `'trained_models/random_forest_model.pkl'` with the desired file path for saving the trained model.

Certainly! Below is an example of a function for a complex machine learning algorithm using Scikit-Learn in the context of the Cybersecurity Threat Detection application. The example function demonstrates the training of a Gradient Boosting Classifier using mock data and saves the trained model to a file path.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
import joblib

def train_gradient_boosting_model(data_path, model_save_path):
    # Load data from the specified path
    data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

    # Assume the data has been preprocessed and contains features and target labels
    X = data.drop(columns=['target'], axis=1)
    y = data['target']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize a Gradient Boosting Classifier
    clf = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3, random_state=42)

    # Train the model
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Evaluate the model
    accuracy = clf.score(X_test, y_test)
    print(f'Model accuracy: {accuracy}')

    # Save the trained model to the specified file path
    joblib.dump(clf, model_save_path)
    print(f'Trained model saved to: {model_save_path}')
```

In this example:
- The function `train_gradient_boosting_model` takes two parameters: `data_path` for the file path of the mock data, and `model_save_path` for the desired file path to save the trained model.
- The function assumes the mock data is in a CSV format and contains features and a target label.
- It uses a Gradient Boosting Classifier from Scikit-Learn to train the model on the data.
- After training, the model is evaluated on a test set, and the accuracy is printed.
- Finally, the trained model is saved to the specified file path using the joblib library.

You can use this function by providing the file path to your mock data and the desired location for saving the trained model. For example:
```python
train_gradient_boosting_model(data_path='path_to_mock_data.csv', model_save_path='trained_models/gradient_boosting_model.pkl')
```
Ensure to replace `'path_to_mock_data.csv'` with the actual file path of your mock data and `'trained_models/gradient_boosting_model.pkl'` with the desired file path for saving the trained model.
