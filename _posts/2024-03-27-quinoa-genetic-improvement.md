## Primary Focus and Target Variable

In the project "Quinoa Genetic Improvement - Applying AI in genetic research to enhance quinoa varieties for better yield, nutritional value, and resilience to changing climate conditions in Peru," the primary focus should be on identifying genetic markers associated with high yield, superior nutritional content, and resilience to climate change in quinoa.

### Target Variable Name:
- **"Optimal Quinoa Varietal Score (OQVS)"**

### Importance:
The target variable, OQVS, is crucial as it combines multiple essential factors into a single metric that represents the overall quality and performance of a quinoa variety. By integrating yield, nutritional value, and resilience to changing climate conditions into one score, researchers and farmers can efficiently evaluate and compare different quinoa varieties to determine the most suitable ones for cultivation.

### Example Values and Decision Making:
- **Quinoa Variety A:**  
  - Yield Potential: 4  
  - Nutritional Value: 8  
  - Climate Resilience: 6  
  - **OQVS:** (4+8+6) = 18  

- **Quinoa Variety B:**  
  - Yield Potential: 7  
  - Nutritional Value: 7  
  - Climate Resilience: 5  
  - **OQVS:** (7+7+5) = 19  

In this scenario, based on the OQVS scores:
- **Quinoa Variety B** outperforms Variety A as it has a higher overall score.
- Farmers can make informed decisions on which variety to plant based on this score, ensuring improved yield, nutrition, and resilience to climate challenges.

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Fictitious Mocked Data
data = {
    'GeneticMarker1': [0.1, 0.3, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5],
    'GeneticMarker2': [0.8, 0.6, 0.7, 0.9, 0.75],
    'Yield': [10, 15, 12, 18, 20],
    'NutritionalValue': [50, 55, 60, 45, 52],
    'ClimateResilience': [3, 4, 5, 2, 6],
    'OQVS': [75, 80, 85, 70, 90]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Define input (X) and target (y) variables
X = df[['GeneticMarker1', 'GeneticMarker2', 'Yield', 'NutritionalValue', 'ClimateResilience']]
y = df['OQVS']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Random Forest Regressor model
rf_model = RandomForestRegressor()
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict values for the test set
y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
print("Predicted OQVS values for the test set:")
print(y_pred)
```

This Python script generates fictitious mocked data representing genetic markers, yield, nutritional value, climate resilience, and the target variable OQVS for quinoa varieties. It then splits the data into training and testing sets, trains a Random Forest Regressor model, predicts the OQVS values for the test set, and evaluates the model's performance using Mean Squared Error. The model's performance can be further optimized by tuning hyperparameters, feature selection, and cross-validation techniques.

## Secondary Target Variable: "Cultivation Success Score (CSS)"

### Importance:
The "Cultivation Success Score (CSS)" could play a critical role in enhancing the predictive model's accuracy and providing valuable insights into the success of cultivating a specific quinoa variety. CSS incorporates factors like soil adaptability, pest resistance, water requirements, and overall growth suitability for a particular location.

### How CSS Complements OQVS:
- **Example Values:**
