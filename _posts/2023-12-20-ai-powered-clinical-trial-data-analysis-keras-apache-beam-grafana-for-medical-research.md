This script uses Keras for model training and Apache Beam for handling mock data. The example assumes that the script is located in the `model_training/` directory within the project structure.

Filename: `model_training_script.py`

```python
import apache_beam as beam
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras

## Mock Data Collection using Apache Beam
class GenerateMockData(beam.DoFn):
    def process(self, element):
        ## Generate mock data for training
        mock_features = [...]  ## Mock feature data
        mock_labels = [...]    ## Mock label data
        yield (mock_features, mock_labels)

## Define the model architecture using Keras
def create_model(input_shape, num_classes):
    model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_shape,)),
        keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
    ])

    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

def main():
    ## Initialize Apache Beam pipeline
    with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
        ## Generate mock data
        mock_data = (pipeline
                     | 'CreateMockData' >> beam.Create([1])  ## Create a single element (considering mock data generation)
                     | 'GenerateMockFeaturesAndLabels' >> beam.ParDo(GenerateMockData()))

        ## Convert mock data to TensorFlow dataset
        dataset = (mock_data
                   | 'CreateTFDataset' >> beam.Map(lambda x: (tf.constant(x[0]), tf.constant(x[1]))))

        ## Define input shape and number of classes for the model
        input_shape =  ## Define input shape based on mock data
        num_classes =  ## Define the number of classes based on the problem domain

        ## Create and compile the model
        model = create_model(input_shape, num_classes)

        ## Extract features and labels from the dataset
        features, labels = next(iter(dataset))

        ## Train the model using mock data
        model.fit(features, labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

Filename: `complex_machine_learning_algorithm.py`

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import joblib

## Load mock clinical trial data (replace with your actual data loading logic)
def load_mock_clinical_trial_data():
    ## Mock data loading process
    features = np.random.random((1000, 10))  ## Mock features
    labels = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=1000)  ## Mock labels (binary classification)
    return features, labels

def complex_machine_learning_algorithm():
    ## Load mock clinical trial data
    features, labels = load_mock_clinical_trial_data()

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Initialize and train a complex machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest)
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=5, random_state=0)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    ## Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    ## Calculate accuracy
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f'Accuracy of the complex machine learning algorithm: {accuracy:.2f}')

    ## Save the trained model to a file
    joblib.dump(model, 'complex_machine_learning_model.pkl')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    complex_machine_learning_algorithm()
```

In this script:

- The `load_mock_clinical_trial_data` function simulates the loading process of mock clinical trial data, including features and labels.
- The `complex_machine_learning_algorithm` function implements a complex machine learning algorithm (Random Forest in this example) to train on the mock clinical trial data and save the trained model to a file.
