```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def train_complex_ml_algorithm(data_file_path):
    # Load mock data from the specified file path
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, encode categorical features)

    # Split the data into features and target variable
    X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = data['target']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize and train a complex machine learning algorithm (e.g., Gradient Boosting Classifier)
    model = GradientBoostingClassifier()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model performance
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    return model, accuracy
```

In the above function `train_complex_ml_algorithm`, a complex machine learning algorithm (Gradient Boosting Classifier) is trained using mock data loaded from a specified file path. The function performs data preprocessing, splits the data into training and testing sets, initializes and trains the model, and evaluates the model's performance using accuracy as the metric.

To use this function, provide the file path where the mock data is stored and call the function as follows:
```python
file_path = 'path_to_mock_data.csv'
trained_model, model_accuracy = train_complex_ml_algorithm(file_path)
```
Replace `'path_to_mock_data.csv'` with the actual file path containing the mock data.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def train_complex_dl_algorithm(data_file_path):
    # Load mock data from the specified file path
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, encode categorical features)

    # Split the data into features and target variable
    X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = data['target']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize a deep learning model
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(Dense(128, input_dim=X.shape[1], activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
    model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

    # Compile the model
    model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    # Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = (model.predict(X_test) > 0.5).astype("int32")

    # Evaluate the model performance
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    return model, accuracy
```

In the above function `train_complex_dl_algorithm`, a complex deep learning algorithm is trained using mock data loaded from a specified file path. The function performs data preprocessing, splits the data into training and testing sets, initializes and trains the deep learning model using a Sequential API from TensorFlow's Keras, and evaluates the model's performance using accuracy as the metric.

To use this function, provide the file path where the mock data is stored and call the function as follows:
```python
file_path = 'path_to_mock_data.csv'
trained_dl_model, model_accuracy = train_complex_dl_algorithm(file_path)
```
Replace `'path_to_mock_data.csv'` with the actual file path containing the mock data.
