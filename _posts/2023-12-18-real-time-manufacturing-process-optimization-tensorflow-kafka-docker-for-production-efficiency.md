Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a machine learning model using mock data for the Real-time Manufacturing Process Optimization application. The script is named `train_model.py` and is located in the `models/` directory of the repository.

```python
# models/train_model.py

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Mock data generation (replace with actual data loading)
def generate_mock_data():
    num_samples = 1000
    num_features = 10
    X = np.random.rand(num_samples, num_features)
    y = np.random.randint(2, size=num_samples)  # Binary classification labels
    return X, y

# Define and compile the TensorFlow model
def create_model(input_shape):
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_shape,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='binary_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

def main():
    # Generate mock data
    X, y = generate_mock_data()

    # Create the model
    model = create_model(input_shape=X.shape[1])

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

    # Save the trained model
    model.save('trained_models/mock_model')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this script:
- Mock data is generated using the `generate_mock_data` function, simulating the input features (X) and binary classification labels (y).
- The `create_model` function defines a simple TensorFlow model architecture for binary classification and compiles it with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.
- The model is trained on the mock data using the `fit` method, and the trained model is then saved to the `trained_models/mock_model` directory.

This script serves as a placeholder for the actual model training process and can be replaced with real data loading and model architecture specific to the Real-time Manufacturing Process Optimization application.

The file path for this script in the repository is `realtime-manufacturing-process-optimization/models/train_model.py`.

```python
# models/train_model_complex.py

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Mock data generation (replace with actual data loading)
def generate_mock_data():
    num_samples = 1000
    num_features = 20
    X = np.random.rand(num_samples, num_features)
    y = np.random.randint(3, size=num_samples)  # Multiclass classification labels
    return X, y

# Define and compile a more complex TensorFlow model
def create_complex_model(input_shape, num_classes):
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_shape,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.3),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

def main():
    # Generate mock data
    X, y = generate_mock_data()

    # Create the more complex model
    num_classes = len(np.unique(y))
    model = create_complex_model(input_shape=X.shape[1], num_classes=num_classes)

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X, y, epochs=20, batch_size=64, validation_split=0.2)

    # Save the trained model
    model.save('trained_models/complex_mock_model')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this script:
- Mock data is generated using the `generate_mock_data` function, simulating the input features (X) and multiclass classification labels (y).
- The `create_complex_model` function defines a more complex TensorFlow model architecture for multiclass classification and compiles it with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss.
- The model is trained on the mock data using the `fit` method, and the trained model is then saved to the `trained_models/complex_mock_model` directory.

The file path for this script in the repository is `realtime-manufacturing-process-optimization/models/train_model_complex.py`.
