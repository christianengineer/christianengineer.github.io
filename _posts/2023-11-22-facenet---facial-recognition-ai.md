Certainly! Below is an example of a function that represents a complex machine learning algorithm using mock data for the FaceNet - Facial Recognition AI application. In this example, we'll create a function for training the FaceNet model using mock data. The function loads mock image data, preprocesses it, and then trains the FaceNet model on the mock dataset.

```python
import numpy as np
import os
import tensorflow as tf
from utils.data_utils.data_loader import load_mock_training_data
from models.facenet import FaceNetModel

def train_facenet_model(mock_data_dir, epochs=10, batch_size=32, learning_rate=0.001):
    """
    Train the FaceNet model using mock data.

    Args:
    - mock_data_dir: Directory containing mock training data
    - epochs: Number of training epochs
    - batch_size: Batch size for training
    - learning_rate: Learning rate for the optimizer

    Returns:
    - trained_model: Trained FaceNet model
    """

    ## Load mock training data
    X_train, Y_train = load_mock_training_data(mock_data_dir)

    ## Preprocess the data (e.g., normalization, resizing)
    X_train_preprocessed = preprocess_data(X_train)

    ## Initialize FaceNet model
    facenet_model = FaceNetModel()

    ## Compile the model
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=learning_rate)
    facenet_model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mean_squared_error')

    ## Train the model
    facenet_model.fit(X_train_preprocessed, Y_train, epochs=epochs, batch_size=batch_size)

    ## Save the trained model
    model_save_path = 'trained_models/facenet_trained_model.h5'
    if not os.path.exists('trained_models'):
        os.makedirs('trained_models')
    facenet_model.save(model_save_path)

    return facenet_model
```

In this example, the `train_facenet_model` function takes mock data directory, training parameters (e.g., epochs, batch size, learning rate) as input, and returns the trained FaceNet model. The function utilizes the `FaceNetModel` class from the `models.facenet` module and `load_mock_training_data` function from the `utils.data_utils.data_loader` module to load mock training data.

The mock training data can be located in a directory specified by `mock_data_dir` and should include mock images and corresponding labels. The function preprocesses the data, initializes and compiles the FaceNet model using TensorFlow/Keras, and then trains the model using the mock data. After training, the function saves the trained model to a specified file path.

This function demonstrates a simplified representation of training a complex machine learning algorithm like FaceNet using mock data for the purpose of illustration.

Certainly! Here's an example of a function representing a complex deep learning algorithm for the FaceNet - Facial Recognition AI application, using mock data. This example focuses on the training of the FaceNet model using TensorFlow/Keras. The function loads mock image data, preprocesses it, and then trains the FaceNet model on the mock dataset.

```python
import os
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from models.facenet import FaceNetModel
from utils.data_utils import load_mock_training_data, preprocess_images

def train_facenet_model(mock_data_dir, epochs=10, batch_size=32, learning_rate=0.001):
    """
    Train the FaceNet model using mock data.

    Args:
    - mock_data_dir: Directory containing mock training data
    - epochs: Number of training epochs
    - batch_size: Batch size for training
    - learning_rate: Learning rate for the optimizer

    Returns:
    - trained_model: Trained FaceNet model
    """

    ## Load mock training data
    X_train, Y_train = load_mock_training_data(mock_data_dir)

    ## Preprocess the data
    X_train_preprocessed = preprocess_images(X_train)

    ## Initialize and compile the FaceNet model
    facenet_model = FaceNetModel()
    optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=learning_rate)
    facenet_model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mean_squared_error')

    ## Train the model
    facenet_model.fit(X_train_preprocessed, Y_train, epochs=epochs, batch_size=batch_size)

    ## Save the trained model
    model_save_path = 'trained_models/facenet_trained_model.h5'
    if not os.path.exists('trained_models'):
        os.makedirs('trained_models')
    facenet_model.save(model_save_path)

    return facenet_model
```

In this example, the `train_facenet_model` function takes the mock data directory, training parameters (e.g., epochs, batch size, learning rate) as input, and returns the trained FaceNet model. The function utilizes the `FaceNetModel` class for the neural network architecture and `load_mock_training_data` function for loading the mock training data. Additionally, `preprocess_images` can be a utility function for preprocessing the input images before training.

The mock training data can be assumed to have image arrays as input features (`X_train`) and corresponding labels or embeddings (`Y_train`). The function preprocesses the input images, initializes and compiles the FaceNet model using TensorFlow/Keras, and then trains the model using the mock data. After training, the function saves the trained model to a specified file path.

This function exemplifies training a complex deep learning algorithm (FaceNet) using mock data for illustrative purposes. It showcases the integration of data loading, preprocessing, model training, and model saving within a single function for training the FaceNet - Facial Recognition AI application.
