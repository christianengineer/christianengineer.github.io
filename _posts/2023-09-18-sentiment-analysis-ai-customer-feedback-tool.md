## Repository: Sentiment Analysis Tool for Customer Feedback

---

### Description:
This repository hosts the source code for a Sentiment Analysis Tool designed to interpret and classify customer feedback using a combination of data mining, machine learning, and Natural Language Processing techniques. As a Full Stack Software Engineer, you will be required to contribute to the enhancement of this tool by developing efficient algorithms, scalable solutions, and user-friendly interfaces.

### Goals:
The primary aims of the tool development are as follows:

- To extract, understand, and categorize sentiments from customer feedback in text format from various sources such as social media platforms, website comments, reviews, etc.
- To enhance the understanding of customer behavior, improve user experience, and provide actionable insights to various teams for strategic decision-making.
- To develop a user-friendly interface that can handle multiple user requests simultaneously in real-time.
- To ensure the tool is scalable, robust, and can handle large volumes of data effectively.
- To establish an efficient data pipeline for real-time feedback analysis.

### Libraries and Tools:
To achieve the above goals, we plan to utilize the following libraries and tools:

**Data Handling and Processing:**
- **Pandas:** This library will be essential for loading, manipulating, and analyzing the customer feedback data in Python.
- **NumPy:** We'll use this Python package for numerical operations and handling multi-dimensional arrays.

**Natural Language Processing:**
- **NLTK:** This leading platform will help us work with human language data for sentiment analysis.
- **spaCy:** An excellent NLP library in Python that will help in text preprocessing.
- **TextBlob:** This Python library will be used for processing textual data, it provides a simple API for delving into common NLP tasks.

**Machine Learning:**
- **Scikit-Learn:** We'll make use of this tool for machine learning model development and validation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** These libraries will be used for constructing deep learning models for sentiment analysis, if needed.

**Web Frameworks:**
- **Node.js:** We'll building scalable network applications to manage concurrent user requests.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework to aid us in creating our server-side logic.
- **React.js:** To handle the client-side of our application, we will take advantage of this JavaScript library due to its efficiency and flexibility.

**Database Management:**
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database, MongoDB will be used for handling large amounts of data and simplifying the process of storing and retrieving data.

By using these powerful libraries and tools, we hope to create a highly efficient, user-friendly, and scalable Sentiment Analysis Tool for customer feedback. 

We look forward to engaging with a talented Full Stack Software Engineer who can contribute valuable skills and insights to our exciting project.

The directory structure for the Sentiment Analysis Tool is as follows:

- `client`: Contains all the frontend code.
- `client/public`: Responsible for serving static and index files of our application.
- `client/src`: Consists of all the source codes for our React application.
- `client/src/services`: Contains services for making API calls.
- `client/src/components`: Holds all the React components.
- `server`: Contains all the backend code.
- `server/controllers`: Houses the controller that handles logic for routing.
- `server/models`: Defines the schema for the data models.
- `server/routes`: Defines the routing logic.
- `server/utils`: Keeps utility functions and helpers.
- `data`: Contains the training and test datasets.
- `data/training`: Houses the text files for positive and negative sentiments for model training.
- `data/test`: Houses the text files for positive and negative sentiments for model testing.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies the file types to be ignored by git.
- `README.md`: Documentation and other details about the project.
- `package.json`: Lists the packages your project depends on, specifies versions of a package that your project can use using semantic versioning rules.


The following is a fictitious sample code file named `sentimentAnalysis.js` located in `server/utils/` directory. This script leverages the 'Natural' NLP library to perform sentiment analysis on customer feedback.

```markdown
/server/utils/sentimentAnalysis.js
```

```javascript
const natural = require('natural');

// Use the AFINN-165 wordlist-based sentiment analysis
const analyzer = new natural.SentimentAnalyzer('English', natural.Afinn, 'stem');

/**
 * Function to preprocess the text.
 * @param {String} text - The customer feedback.
 * @returns {Array} - The preprocessed text.
 */
function preprocessText(text) {
    return text.toLowerCase().match(/\b\w+\b/g);
}

/**
 * Function to perform sentiment analysis on customer feedback.
 * @param {String} text - The customer feedback.
 * @returns {Number} - The sentiment score (-5 to 5).
 */
function analyzeFeedback(text) {
    const tokens = preprocessText(text);
    const analysisResult = analyzer.getSentiment(tokens);
    return analysisResult;
}

module.exports = {
    analyzeFeedback
}
```
This file handles the primary logic for our sentiment analysis tool. It uses the AFINN-165 wordlist-based sentiment analysis approach, which works by associating each word in the English language with a degree of sentiment, either positive or negative. The `analyzeFeedback` function processes the input text and returns a sentiment score. The feedback is then classified based on this score.
