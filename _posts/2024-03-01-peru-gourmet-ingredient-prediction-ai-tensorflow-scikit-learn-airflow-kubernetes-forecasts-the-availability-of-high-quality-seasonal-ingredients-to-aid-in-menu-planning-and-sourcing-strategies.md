# AI Peru Gourmet Ingredient Prediction Project

## Objectives
The objective of the AI Peru Gourmet Ingredient Prediction AI project is to forecast the availability of high-quality, seasonal ingredients to aid in menu planning and sourcing strategies for the culinary industry in Peru. By leveraging Machine Learning techniques, the system aims to provide accurate predictions that help businesses make informed decisions on ingredient procurement and menu creation.

## System Design Strategies
1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical data on ingredient availability, quality, and seasonality. Include external factors such as weather patterns, market trends, and supplier information.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, preprocess, and feature engineer the data to make it suitable for training Machine Learning models. Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features as needed.
   
3. **Machine Learning Models**: Utilize TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn libraries to build predictive models. Experiment with various algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or LSTM networks to capture complex patterns in the data.
   
4. **Model Training & Evaluation**: Train models on historical data and validate performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error, R2 Score, or MAPE. Fine-tune hyperparameters through techniques like Cross-validation or Grid Search.
   
5. **Deployment**: Use Airflow for workflow management to schedule data updates, model retraining, and predictions. Deploy models on Kubernetes clusters for scalability and reliability.
   
6. **Monitoring & Maintenance**: Implement logging, monitoring, and alerting mechanisms to track model performance and system health. Set up regular maintenance tasks to ensure the models remain accurate and up-to-date.

## Chosen Libraries
1. **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow is a powerful open-source Machine Learning library developed by Google that provides a flexible ecosystem for building and deploying ML models. Its high-level APIs, like Keras, make it easy to create neural networks for tasks like time series forecasting and regression.
   
2. **Scikit-Learn**: Scikit-Learn is a simple and efficient tool for data mining and data analysis. It provides a wide range of algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and model selection. Its user-friendly interface makes it ideal for prototyping and experimentation.
   
3. **Airflow**: Apache Airflow is a platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It allows you to define complex DAGs for data pipelines, ensuring data is processed in a timely and reliable manner.
   
4. **Kubernetes**: Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It ensures your AI models are running efficiently and can handle varying workloads.

By combining these libraries with sound system design strategies, the AI Peru Gourmet Ingredient Prediction AI project aims to deliver accurate forecasts that can optimize menu planning and sourcing strategies in the culinary industry.

I'll generate a sample Python script for training a model for the Peru Gourmet Ingredient Prediction AI using mock data. The script will showcase how to preprocess the data, train a Machine Learning model using Scikit-Learn, and save the trained model for deployment. Below is the file content:

```python
# File Path: /src/model_training/train_model_mock_data.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import joblib

# Load mock dataset (replace with actual data loading code)
data = pd.read_csv('/data/mock_data.csv')

# Data preprocessing
X = data.drop('target_column', axis=1)
y = data['target_column']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train a Random Forest model (replace with actual model training code)
rf_model = RandomForestRegressor()
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = rf_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model performance
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')

# Save the trained model (replace with actual model saving code)
joblib.dump(rf_model, '/models/random_forest_model_mock.pkl')
```

In this script:
- We load mock data from a CSV file (`mock_data.csv`).
- Preprocess the data by splitting it into features (X) and the target column (y).
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train a Random Forest model on the training data.
- Make predictions on the test set and evaluate the model's performance using Mean Squared Error.
- Finally, save the trained model as a joblib file (`random_forest_model_mock.pkl`).

This script is a template that can be adapted to work with real data for training the Peru Gourmet Ingredient Prediction AI model. The file is saved at the specified file path `/src/model_training/train_model_mock_data.py`.

I'll create a Python script for training a complex Machine Learning algorithm on mock data for the Peru Gourmet Ingredient Prediction AI project. This script will demonstrate the usage of a more advanced algorithm, such as a Gradient Boosting Regressor from Scikit-Learn. Here is the file content:

```python
# File Path: /src/model_training/train_complex_model_mock_data.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import joblib

# Load mock dataset (replace with actual data loading code)
data = pd.read_csv('/data/mock_data.csv')

# Data preprocessing
X = data.drop('target_column', axis=1)
y = data['target_column']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train a Gradient Boosting Regressor model (replace with actual model training code)
gb_model = GradientBoostingRegressor()
gb_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = gb_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model performance
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')

# Save the trained model (replace with actual model saving code)
joblib.dump(gb_model, '/models/gradient_boosting_model_mock.pkl')
```

In this script:
- We again load mock data from a CSV file (`mock_data.csv`).
- Preprocess the data by splitting it into features (X) and the target column (y).
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train a Gradient Boosting Regressor model on the training data.
- Make predictions on the test set and evaluate the model's performance using Mean Squared Error.
- Finally, save the trained model as a joblib file (`gradient_boosting_model_mock.pkl`).

This script showcases a more advanced model training process using a Gradient Boosting Regressor. It can be tailored to work with actual data for training the complex Machine Learning algorithm of the Peru Gourmet Ingredient Prediction AI. The file is saved at the specified file path `/src/model_training/train_complex_model_mock_data.py`.
