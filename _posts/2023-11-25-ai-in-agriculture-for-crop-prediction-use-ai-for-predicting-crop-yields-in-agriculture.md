2. Data Preprocessing: Implement data preprocessing techniques to clean, normalize, and transform the raw data into a format suitable for training machine learning models.
3. Model Development: Utilize machine learning and deep learning techniques to develop predictive models capable of forecasting crop yields based on the collected and preprocessed data.
4. Integration: Develop APIs for seamless integration of the crop yield prediction model with agricultural management systems, enabling easy access and utilization by farmers and agricultural stakeholders.

## Chosen Libraries
1. **TensorFlow/Keras**: for building and training deep learning models for crop yield prediction.
