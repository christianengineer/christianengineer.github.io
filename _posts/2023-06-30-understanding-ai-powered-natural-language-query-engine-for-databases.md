### Natural Language Query Engine for Databases

#### Description:

The Natural Language Query Engine for Databases was developed with the objective of simplifying and expediting data access for non-technical users. Leveraging the power of AI, this revolutionary tool transforms complex SQL queries into simple, easily understandable natural language.

Rather than writing SQL queries, users can input natural language search requests, such as "Show me sales data for the last quarter," and the Natural Language Query Engine will convert this request into the corresponding SQL query.

#### Goals:

The primary goals of this project are:

1. **Simplify data access:** Making complicated database systems more accessible for non-technical users.

2. **Increase productivity:** Speeding data retrieval and enabling users to interact with databases in real-time using natural language.

3. **Flexible integration:** Easy to integrate with any database system that supports SQL.

4. **Scalability:** Ensuring the Query Engine can handle growing amounts of data and increased user traffic.

#### Libraries and Tools Used:

For successful and efficient data handling and scalability, the following libraries and tools will be engaged:

- **SQLAlchemy:** SQLAlchemy is a SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system for Python. This toolkit is used to connect and interact with a variety of SQL databases with Python code. It also aids in creating, deleting, selecting, and updating data entries.

- **Spacy:** A powerful and flexible Python library for Natural Language Processing (NLP), Spacy is used to process and understand the natural language queries.

- **Flask:** A lightweight Python web framework that allows for seamless web application development and integration of the Natural Language Query Engine.

- **Gunicorn:** A Python WSGI HTTP server to manage and handle increased traffic, ensuring the Query Engine is robust and scalable.

- **Redis:** An open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a cache, database, and message broker. Redis is primarily used to handle and manage user sessions and to cache results for scalability.

- **Docker:** Docker is a platform to automate the deployment, scaling, and isolation of applications using containerization. It allows consistency across multiple development and production environments, ensuring seamless integration and scalability.

Here's a proposed scalable file structure for the Natural Language Query Engine for Databases repository:

```

Brief Explanation of the file structure:

- **app:** This directory contains the main source code for the project.
- **docs:** Contains the project's documentation like README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md.
- **test:** This directory is for the test scripts and test data.
- **.dockerignore:** Lists files and directories to ignore when building docker images.
- **.gitignore:** Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
- **Dockerfile:** Contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble a Docker image.
- **requirements.txt:** A file containing a list of items to be installed using pip install.
- **README.md:** Provides information about the project and instructions on how to use it.

# Natural-Language-Query-Engine/app/nlqe_logic.py

```python
# Importing Required Libraries
import spacy
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Load the Spacy Model
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')

# Connect to the database
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///app.db')

# Function to Parse Natural Language Query
def parse_query(query):
    nlp_query = nlp(query)

    # Use the NLP model to understand the query
    # This is an example, and would need to be much more complex in a real application
    for token in nlp_query:
        if token.pos_ == 'NOUN':
            table_name = token.text
        if token.dep_=='amod':
            condition = token.text

    # Construct SQL query
    sql_query = f"SELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE {condition}"

    return sql_query


# Function to Execute SQL Query and Fetch Result
def execute_query(sql_query):
    result = engine.execute(sql_query)

    # Convert result to a list of dictionaries
    result_list = [dict(row) for row in result]

    return result_list

# Function to Process Natural Language Query and Fetch Result
def process_query(query):
    # Parse the query
    sql_query = parse_query(query)

    # Execute the query and fetch result
    result = execute_query(sql_query)

    return result
```

```

Explanation of the Python code above:
- First, we load the Spacy model and establish a connection to the SQL database.
- The `parse_query` function uses Spacy to parse and understand a natural language query, and then it transforms it into an SQL query. This is oversimplified and in a production environment, this transformation would be much more sophisticated.
- `execute_query` function then takes an SQL query, executes it on the database, and fetches the results.
- Finally, `process_query` is the main function that takes a natural language query, converts it to SQL with `parse_query`, and fetches the result with `execute_query`.
