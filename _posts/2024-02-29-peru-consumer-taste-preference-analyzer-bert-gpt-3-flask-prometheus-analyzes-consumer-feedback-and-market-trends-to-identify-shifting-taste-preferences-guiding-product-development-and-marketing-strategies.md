I'll provide a sample script for training a model using mock data for the Peru Consumer Taste Preference Analyzer application. This script will be for training a simple mock model using Scikit-learn as an example.

### Training Script for Mock Model (train_model.py)

```python
## train_model.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
import joblib

## Load mock data
data_path = "data/mock_data.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

## Separate features and target
X = data.drop('target_column', axis=1)
y = data['target_column']

## Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Initialize and train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

## Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Model Accuracy:", accuracy)

## Generate classification report
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

## Save the trained model to a file
model_output_path = "models/mock_model.pkl"
joblib.dump(model, model_output_path)
print("Trained model saved successfully.")
```

### File Path:

    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

## Compile the model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001), metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
