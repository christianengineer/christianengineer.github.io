    <h1>The Two Pointers Pattern</h1>
    <p>The Two Pointers pattern becomes valuable for problems dealing with sorted arrays and linked lists, needing to
        find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints. The elements could be a pair, a triplet, or a subarray.
        For example, take a look at the following problem:</p>
    <div class="problem-statement">
        <p>You have two inputs, an array of sorted numbers and a target number.</p>
        <p>Find a pair of numbers within the array where their sum equals the target number.</p>
    </div>
    <p>To solve this problem, we can consider each element one by one (pointed out by the first pointer) and iterate
        through the remaining elements (pointed out by the second pointer) to find a pair with the given target sum.
    </p>
    <p class="time-complexity">Time complexity: O(L<sup>2</sup>)O(L)</p>
    <p>L represents the length of the input array.</p>
    <p>Since we don't have to sort the input array again, an efficient way would be to start with one pointer at the
        beginning and another at the end.</p>
    <p>On each iteration, we'll check if the numbers pointed by the two pointers are equal to the target sum. If they
        don't, we will we can proceed with these steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the sum of the two current pointed numbers exceeds our target number, we must keep trying to find a pair
            of numbers with a smaller sum. We can keep searching for a smaller sum by decrementing the value of the
            end-pointer for the next iteration.</li>
        <li>If the current sum of the two numbers is less than our target number, we can continue searching for a bigger
            sum by incrementing the start-pointer for the next iteration.</li>
    </ul>
