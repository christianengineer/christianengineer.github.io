```python
# File: model_training/mock_data_training.py

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Mock data generation (Replace this with actual data pipeline)
def generate_mock_data():
    # Generate mock input data
    X_train = tf.random.normal((1000, 32, 32, 3))
    y_train = tf.random.uniform((1000,), maxval=10, dtype=tf.int32)
    return X_train, y_train

# Define a simple convolutional neural network model
def build_cnn_model(input_shape, num_classes):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
        layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
        layers.Flatten(),
        layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
    ])
    return model

# Main function for model training
def train_model():
    # Generate mock data
    X_train, y_train = generate_mock_data()
    
    # Build the model
    input_shape = X_train[0].shape
    num_classes = 10
    model = build_cnn_model(input_shape, num_classes)
    
    # Compile and train the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])
    
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_split=0.2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    train_model()
```

In this file, `mock_data_training.py`, we first define a mock data generation function `generate_mock_data` to create mock input data (`X_train`) and labels (`y_train`). Then, we build a simple convolutional neural network model using TensorFlow's Keras API. Finally, we compile and train the model using the generated mock data. This file serves as a placeholder for the actual model training script, using mock data for demonstration purposes.

The file path for the `mock_data_training.py` is `model_training/mock_data_training.py` within the project directory.

This script serves as a starting point for model training and can be replaced with actual data and model architectures in the production implementation of the Low-Cost Prosthetic Design application.

```python
# File: model_training/complex_algorithm_training.py

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers
import numpy as np

# Mock data generation (Replace this with actual data pipeline)
def generate_mock_data():
    # Generate mock input data
    X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)  # Example feature data
    y_train = np.random.randint(2, size=100)  # Example binary labels
    return X_train, y_train

# Define a complex machine learning algorithm
def build_complex_model(input_dim):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
        layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
        layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    return model

# Main function for training the complex model
def train_complex_model():
    # Generate mock data
    X_train, y_train = generate_mock_data()
    
    # Build the complex model
    input_dim = X_train.shape[1]
    model = build_complex_model(input_dim)
    
    # Compile and train the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='binary_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])
    
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_split=0.2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    train_complex_model()
```

In this file, `complex_algorithm_training.py`, we define a complex machine learning algorithm utilizing TensorFlow's Keras API. The algorithm uses mock data generated by the `generate_mock_data` function to train a model to perform a binary classification task. The implemented algorithm consists of multiple dense layers and utilizes the `adam` optimizer, `binary_crossentropy` loss function, and `accuracy` metric for model training and evaluation.

The file path for the `complex_algorithm_training.py` is `model_training/complex_algorithm_training.py` within the project directory.

This script represents a more complex machine learning algorithm using mock data and can serve as a starting point for developing sophisticated models within the Low-Cost Prosthetic Design application, before being replaced with actual data and model architectures in the production implementation.
