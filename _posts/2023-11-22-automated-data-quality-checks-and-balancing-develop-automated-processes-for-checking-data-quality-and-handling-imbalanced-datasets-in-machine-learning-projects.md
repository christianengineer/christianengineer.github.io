# AI Automated Data Quality Checks and Balancing

## Objectives
The objectives of implementing automated data quality checks and balancing in machine learning projects are to ensure that the input data is of high quality, free from inconsistencies and errors, and to address the issue of imbalanced datasets that could lead to biased model performance.

## System Design Strategies
### Data Quality Checks
1. Automated Data Profiling: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the structure, quality, and distribution of the data. 
2. Data Validation: Implement checks for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. Schema Validation: Verify that the data conforms to the expected schema and data types.

### Balancing Imbalanced Datasets
1. Sampling Techniques: Implement oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic data generation techniques to balance the dataset.
2. Cost-Sensitive Learning: Incorporate class weights or cost-sensitive learning algorithms to give higher importance to minority classes.

### Automation
1. Scheduled Checks: Set up automated processes to regularly check data quality and balance datasets during data ingestion or preprocessing stages.
2. Alerting System: Implement alerts or notifications to inform the team of any data quality issues or imbalanced datasets.

## Chosen Libraries
1. **Data Quality Checks**
   - `pandas-profiling`: For automated data profiling and generating detailed data quality reports.
   - `Great Expectations`: To define and validate data expectations, ensuring data integrity and quality.

2. **Balancing Imbalanced Datasets**
   - `imbalanced-learn`: Implement various sampling techniques such as SMOTE, RandomOverSampler, RandomUnderSampler, etc.
   - `scikit-learn`: Utilize the built-in functionality for cost-sensitive learning and class weighting.

3. **Automation**
   - `Airflow` or `Prefect`: For scheduling and orchestrating the automated data quality checks and balancing processes.
   - `Slack API` or `Email Alerts`: To set up alerting systems for notifying the team about any issues detected during the automated checks.

By integrating these strategies and libraries into the machine learning project repository, we can ensure that the data used for model training is of high quality and that the issue of imbalanced datasets is effectively addressed, leading to more robust and accurate AI applications.

## Infrastructure for Automated Data Quality Checks and Balancing

To implement automated processes for checking data quality and handling imbalanced datasets in machine learning projects, we need a robust infrastructure that supports scalable, efficient, and reliable data processing. Below are the components and considerations for the infrastructure:

### Data Pipeline
- **Data Ingestion**: Utilize tools such as Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis, or Google Cloud Pub/Sub to ingest and stream the incoming data to the processing pipeline.
- **Data Storage**: Store the incoming data in a scalable and fault-tolerant data storage system like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or a distributed file system like HDFS.
- **Data Processing**: Use a distributed processing framework like Apache Spark to perform scalable data processing, including data validation, profiling, and balancing.

### Automated Data Quality Checks
- **Data Profiling Pipeline**: Use Apache Spark or similar distributed processing frameworks to perform automated data profiling and generate comprehensive quality reports.
- **Validation Pipeline**: Implement data validation using Apache Spark or custom scripts to identify missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies within the data.

### Balancing Imbalanced Datasets
- **Sampling Pipeline**: Utilize Apache Spark or custom scripts to implement oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic data generation techniques to balance the datasets.
- **Cost-Sensitive Learning Pipeline**: Incorporate cost-sensitive learning algorithms within the machine learning models, leveraging distributed processing frameworks for training large models with imbalanced datasets.

### Automation
- **Workflow Management**: Use workflow management tools like Apache Airflow or Prefect to schedule and orchestrate the automated data quality checks and dataset balancing tasks.
- **Alerting System Integration**: Integrate with alerting systems using APIs provided by communication platforms such as Slack or email, to notify the team regarding any issues detected during the automated checks.

### Scalability and Reliability
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Deploy the infrastructure using IaC tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to enable repeatable and consistent deployment of the infrastructure.
- **Containerization**: Use containerization with Docker and container orchestration with Kubernetes to ensure easy scaling and efficient resource allocation for the data processing tasks.

By building the infrastructure with these components and considerations, the team can ensure that the automated data quality checks and balancing processes are seamlessly integrated into the machine learning projects application, and can be scaled to handle large volumes of data with high reliability and efficiency.

The function performs data quality checks on the mock data and uses the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to handle imbalanced datasets. Additionally, it uses the Great Expectations library to validate data integrity and quality.

```python

from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
import xgboost as xgb
import great_expectations as ge

def automated_data_processing_and_modeling(data_file_path):
    # Load the data
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)
    
    # Perform data quality checks using Great Expectations
    expectation_suite = ge.dataset.PandasDataset(data).expect_table()
    data_quality_report = expectation_suite.validate(result_format="html")
    # Save the data quality report to the specified file path
    data_quality_report_file_path = "data/processed_data/data_quality_reports/data_quality_report.html"
    with open(data_quality_report_file_path, "w") as file:
        file.write(data_quality_report)

    # Handling imbalanced dataset using SMOTE
    X = data.drop('target_column', axis=1)
    y = data['target_column']
    smote = SMOTE(sampling_strategy='auto')
    X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)
    
    # Training an XGBoost model on the balanced dataset
    clf = xgb.XGBClassifier()
    clf.fit(X_resampled, y_resampled)
