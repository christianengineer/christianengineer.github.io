```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def train_translation_model(data_path):
    ## Load mock multilingual text data
    data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

    ## Split the data into source and target languages
    X = data['source_text']
    y = data['target_language']

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Feature engineering and transformation
    ## ...

    ## Initialize and train the translation model
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    ## Validate the model
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy}")

    ## Save the trained model for serving
    model_file_path = 'translation_model.pkl'
    with open(model_file_path, 'wb') as model_file:
        pickle.dump(model, model_file)

    return model_file_path
```

In this example, the `train_translation_model` function takes the file path to the mock multilingual text data as input. It then uses a RandomForestClassifier as a placeholder for a complex machine learning algorithm to train a translation model. The function also validates the model's accuracy and saves the trained model to a file for serving.

To use this function with mock data, you can call it as follows:

```python
data_path = 'data/mock_translation_data.csv'
trained_model_path = train_translation_model(data_path)
print(f"Trained model saved at: {trained_model_path}")
```

Please replace `'data/mock_translation_data.csv'` with the actual file path to the mock multilingual text data for the training process.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def train_translation_deep_learning_model(data_path, num_epochs=10):
    ## Load mock multilingual text data
    data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

    ## Preprocess data and split into source and target languages
    X = data['source_text']
    y = data['target_text']

    ## Tokenize and pad the text sequences
    ## ...

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Define the deep learning model architecture
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=embedding_dim, input_length=max_sequence_length),
        tf.keras.layers.LSTM(128),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(output_vocab_size, activation='softmax')
    ])

    model.compile(loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

    ## Train the deep learning translation model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=num_epochs, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    ## Save the trained deep learning model
    model_file_path = 'translation_model.h5'
    model.save(model_file_path)

    return model_file_path
```

In this example, the `train_translation_deep_learning_model` function takes the file path to the mock multilingual text data and optionally the number of training epochs as input. It uses TensorFlow's Keras API to define and train a deep learning model for translation. The model is then saved to a file for serving.

To use this function with mock data, you can call it as follows:

```python
data_path = 'data/mock_translation_data.csv'
trained_model_path = train_translation_deep_learning_model(data_path, num_epochs=10)
print(f"Trained model saved at: {trained_model_path}")
```

Please replace `'data/mock_translation_data.csv'` with the actual file path to the mock multilingual text data for the training process.
