To illustrate a file for training a model within the AI-enhanced Pharmaceutical Research application using Scikit-Learn and mock data, we can create a simple Python script named **train.py** for training a machine learning model. Below is a basic outline of the **train.py** file along with a sample mock data file named **mock_data.csv**:

**File Path**: machine_learning/models/model1/train.py

```python
## Necessary imports
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import joblib

## Load mock data (Replace with actual data loading code)
data = pd.read_csv('mock_data.csv')

## Data preprocessing and feature engineering (Replace with actual data preprocessing and feature engineering code)
## ...

## Split data into features and target
X = data.drop('target_column', axis=1)
y = data['target_column']

## Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Initialize the model (Replace with actual model initialization and hyperparameter tuning)
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

## Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

## Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Model accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')

## Save the trained model to a file
joblib.dump(model, 'model1.pkl')
```

In this example:
- The **train.py** file showcases the process of loading mock data, preprocessing, training a model, evaluating its performance, and saving the trained model to a file.
- The **mock_data.csv** is a sample mock data file that contains the input features and the target column required for training the model. This file should be stored in the same directory or the appropriate data directory.

This file serves as a placeholder for training a model within the AI-enhanced Pharmaceutical Research application, and it can be further customized to accommodate the actual data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training steps for specific pharmaceutical research tasks.

For the AI-enhanced Pharmaceutical Research application, the following Python script named **train_complex_model.py** demonstrates the implementation of a complex machine learning algorithm using Scikit-Learn and mock data. This script illustrates the training of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, a more advanced algorithm commonly used in pharmaceutical research for various tasks such as classification and regression.

**File Path**: machine_learning/models/model1/train_complex_model.py

```python
## Necessary imports
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import joblib

## Load mock data (Replace with actual data loading code)
data = pd.read_csv('mock_data.csv')

## Data preprocessing and feature engineering (Replace with actual data preprocessing and feature engineering code)
## ...

## Split data into features and target
X = data.drop('target_column', axis=1)
y = data['target_column']

## Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Initialize the model with preprocessing pipeline
model = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVC(kernel='rbf', C=1.0, gamma='scale', random_state=42))

## Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

## Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Model accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')

## Save the trained model to a file
joblib.dump(model, 'complex_model.pkl')
```

In this script:
- The **train_complex_model.py** file demonstrates the training of a complex machine learning algorithm (Support Vector Machine with radial basis function kernel) using Scikit-Learn and mock data.
- It includes the necessary steps for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model to a file (complex_model.pkl).
- The mock data file (e.g., **mock_data.csv**) is assumed to be available in the same directory or the appropriate data directory.

This file serves as an example of a more advanced machine learning algorithm implementation, which can be further tailored and customized to match the specific requirements of the AI-enhanced Pharmaceutical Research application for drug development.
