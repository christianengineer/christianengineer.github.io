## Introduction

Experimenting with cutting-edge technologies for scalable facial recognition applications, we aim to tackle major issues of data management, software efficiency, and user traffic. This blueprint is crafted for the highly skilled developers, focusing on a well-structured, comprehensive solution for large AI corporations.

## Scalable System Design

Our model adheres to a modular architecture that effectively handles massive data amounts and high user traffic. Decoupling of services allows independent scaling and development of system components.

### Data Handling

Innovative database techniques ensure efficiency while dealing with large-scale data. We use sharding for distributed data:

```python
class ShardManager:
    def get_shard(self, user_id):
        shard_id = hash(user_id) % NUM_SHARDS
        return SHARD_DICT[shard_id]
```

## Robust AI Integration

Facial recognition relies on machine learning models. Efficient training and updating processes are vital to maintain accuracy and performance as data increases.

### Machine Learning Model Training

Model training leverages distributed computing for efficient backpropagation:

```python
from tensorflow import distribute

strategy = distribute.MirroredStrategy()
with strategy.scope():
    model = create_model()
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy')
result = model.fit(dataset, epochs=EPOCHS)
```

## Cloud Platform Integration

Cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud can provide the infrastructure necessary to scale applications effortlessly. They offer several services ranging from database solutions to machine learning platforms.

### API Integration

Integration with cloud APIs ensures seamless data IO and machine learning operations:

```python
from google.cloud import bigquery
client = bigquery.Client()
dataset_ref = client.dataset('my_dataset')
table_ref = dataset_ref.table('my_table')
table = client.get_table(table_ref)
rows = client.list_rows(table, max_results=10)
print([x for x in rows])
```

## Phased Rollout

We adopt a phased rollout strategy to mitigate potential risks. It is crucial to ensure flawless operation at every stage.

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/<deployment-name>
kubectl set image deployment/<deployment-name> <image-name>=<new-version>
```

## Scalability Testing

Robust testing techniques are used to ensure the system can handle anticipated traffic and data load.

```bash
ab -n 10000 -c 100 https://<application-url>/api/
```

This performs a test by simulating 100 concurrent requests until 10,000 requests have been completed.

## Conclusion

This blueprint offers an effective strategy to build applications capable of scalable facial recognition. Dynamic cloud technologies and robust AI integration ensure optimal performance and exceptional user experience, providing an exciting narrative for top-tier developers to immediately engage with. Let's shape the future of AI technologies together.
