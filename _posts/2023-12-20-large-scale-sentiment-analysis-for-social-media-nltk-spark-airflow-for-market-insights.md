df['sentiment_score'] = df['text'].apply(lambda x: sid.polarity_scores(x)['compound'])

## Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("SentimentModelTraining").getOrCreate()

## Create Spark dataframe from the preprocessed data
spark_df = spark.createDataFrame(df)

## Train the sentiment analysis model using Spark ML, e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.
## (Add code for model training using Spark ML)

## Serialize and store the trained model for deployment and evaluation
## (Add code for model serialization)

## Example model training using Spark's Logistic Regression
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
from pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression

## Assemble features
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=['sentiment_score'], outputCol='features')
output = assembler.transform(spark_df)

## Initialize and fit the model
lr = LogisticRegression(labelCol='label', featuresCol='features', maxIter=10, regParam=0.3, elasticNetParam=0.8)
model = lr.fit(output)
