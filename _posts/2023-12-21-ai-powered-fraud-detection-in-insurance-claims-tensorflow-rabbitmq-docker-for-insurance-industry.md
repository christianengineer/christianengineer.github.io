def preprocess_data(data):
    # Data preprocessing steps
    return processed_data

def create_model():
    model = Sequential([
        # Define model architecture
    ])
    return model

def train_model(train_data, train_labels):
    model = create_model()
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
    # Save model
    model.save('trained_fraud_detection_model.h5')
```

    └── main.tf
```

Below, we'll detail the purpose of each file and directory:

### docker-compose.yml
The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the services, networks, and volumes for the application using Docker Compose. It specifies how the various components of the application, such as the fraud detection model, API endpoints, and messaging services like RabbitMQ, should be containerized and connected within the Docker ecosystem.

An example of the contents of `docker-compose.yml` could be:

```

### terraform/
The `terraform` directory contains infrastructure as code (IaC) files, specifically the `main.tf` file, which defines the infrastructure configurations using the Terraform language. This may include resources such as cloud infrastructure, networking, and other components needed to support the AI-powered Fraud Detection in Insurance Claims application.

An example of the contents of `main.tf` could be:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "fraud_detection_cluster" {
  name = "fraud-detection-cluster"
}

# Define additional infrastructure resources here
```

These files and directories in the `deployment` section provide the necessary configurations for deploying the AI-powered Fraud Detection in Insurance Claims application, integrating TensorFlow models, RabbitMQ messaging, and Docker containerization within different deployment environments, supporting scalability, resilience, and efficient management of the application.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a machine learning model for the AI-powered Fraud Detection in Insurance Claims application using mock data. This script utilizes TensorFlow for model training and is designed to preprocess the data, train the model, and save the trained model to a file.

```python
# File Path: app/training_script.py

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Mock data for training (replace with actual data sources in the real application)
training_data = np.random.rand(100, 10)
training_labels = np.random.randint(2, size=100)

# Preprocessing the data (mock preprocessing steps)
def preprocess_data(data):
    # Mock preprocessing, replace with actual preprocessing steps
    processed_data = data  # Placeholder for actual data preprocessing
    return processed_data

# Define the model architecture
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Preprocess the data
processed_training_data = preprocess_data(training_data)

# Train the model
model.fit(processed_training_data, training_labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Save the trained model to a file
model.save('trained_fraud_detection_model.h5')
```

In this example, the training script is located at `app/training_script.py` within the repository. The script generates mock training data, preprocesses the data, defines a simple neural network model using TensorFlow's Keras API, and trains the model using the mock data. Finally, the trained model is saved to a file named `trained_fraud_detection_model.h5`.

Please note that in a production environment, this script would be enhanced to replace the mock data with actual insurance claims data and implement more sophisticated preprocessing and feature engineering techniques. Additionally, mechanisms for model evaluation and validation using real-world data would be incorporated to ensure the model's accuracy and effectiveness.

This file provides a foundational step for training the fraud detection model and would be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline for continuous model training and improvement.

```python
# File Path: models/complex_fraud_detection_model.py

import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score

# Mock data for training and testing (replace with actual data sources in the real application)
def load_mock_data():
    # Load mock data from data source
    X, y = load_data_from_source()  # Placeholder for loading data
    return X, y

# Feature engineering and preprocessing steps (mock data preprocessing)
def preprocess_data(X, y):
    # Perform feature engineering and data preprocessing
    preprocessed_X = X  # Placeholder for actual preprocessing
    return preprocessed_X, y

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X, y = load_mock_data()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Preprocess the data
X_train_processed, y_train_processed = preprocess_data(X_train, y_train)

# Define a complex machine learning algorithm (Random Forest Classifier)
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train_processed, y_train_processed)

# Evaluate the model
def evaluate_model(X_test, y_test, model):
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
    recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print("Model Evaluation:")
    print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}, Precision: {precision:.2f}, Recall: {recall:.2f}")

# Evaluate the model on the test set
X_test_processed, y_test_processed = preprocess_data(X_test, y_test)
evaluate_model(X_test_processed, y_test_processed, model)

# Save the trained model to a file (for deployment)
import joblib
model_file_path = 'trained_complex_fraud_detection_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, model_file_path)
```

In this example, the complex machine learning algorithm for fraud detection is defined in the `models/complex_fraud_detection_model.py` file within the repository. The script utilizes a Random Forest Classifier from the scikit-learn library to build the model. It also includes data loading, preprocessing, splitting into training and testing sets, model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model to a file.

Please note that this is a mock example using a simplification of complex model training and evaluation processes. In a real-world scenario, the machine learning algorithm and feature engineering steps would be more comprehensive and tailored to the specific requirements of fraud detection in insurance claims.

This file provides a foundation for implementing more complex machine learning algorithms for fraud detection in the AI-powered Fraud Detection in Insurance Claims application and would be integrated into the model training pipeline for continuous model improvement.
