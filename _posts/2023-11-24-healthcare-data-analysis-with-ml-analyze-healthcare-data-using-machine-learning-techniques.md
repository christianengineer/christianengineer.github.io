2. **Data Security and Privacy**: Implement robust security measures such as data encryption, access controls, and compliance with healthcare data privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA in the US).
3. **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Design a modular and scalable ML pipeline that can handle data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and inference efficiently. Use frameworks like TensorFlow Extended (TFX) or Apache Beam to build scalable ML pipelines.
4. **Cloud Integration**: Consider integrating with cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure for scalable compute and storage options.

### Chosen Libraries

1. **PyTorch or TensorFlow**: Choose a deep learning framework for building and training advanced ML models for healthcare data analysis.

By organizing the deployment files in this manner, the "Healthcare Data Analysis with ML" application can be efficiently prepared and deployed as a scalable, containerized service, ready for integration with other components of the overall system.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def complex_machine_learning_algorithm(data_file_path):
    ## Load mock data from file
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Preprocessing, feature engineering, etc.
    ## ...

    ## Split data into features and target variable
    X = data.drop('target_column', axis=1)
    y = data['target_column']

    ## Split data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Initialize and fit the complex machine learning model
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    ## Make predictions on the test set
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    ## Evaluate the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

    return model, accuracy
```

In the above function `complex_machine_learning_algorithm`, the input `data_file_path` represents the file path to the mock data used for training the machine learning model. This function performs the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Reads mock data from the specified file path using pandas.
2. **Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**: Placeholder comments indicate that preprocessing and feature engineering steps should be implemented here to prepare the data for training.
3. **Splitting Data**: Splits the data into features (X) and the target variable (y), followed by a further split into training and testing sets.
4. **Model Training**: Initializes and fits a complex machine learning model (Random Forest classifier in this case) on the training data.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Makes predictions on the test set and evaluates the model's performance using accuracy as the metric.

This function serves as a starting point for implementing a machine learning algorithm within the "Healthcare Data Analysis with ML" application. Actual preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training logic would need to be implemented or integrated based on the specific requirements and characteristics of the healthcare data being analyzed.

```python

    ## Split data into features and target variable
    X = data.drop('target_column', axis=1)
    y = data['target_column']

    ## Split data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Initialize and build the deep learning model
    model = Sequential([
        Dense(128, input_shape=(X.shape[1],), activation='relu'),
        Dropout(0.3),
        Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        Dropout(0.3),
        Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

    model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    ## Train the deep learning model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    ## Evaluate the model
    _, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)

    return model, accuracy
```
