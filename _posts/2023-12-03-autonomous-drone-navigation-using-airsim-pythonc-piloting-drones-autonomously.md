    y = training_data['target_label']

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Instantiate the complex machine learning algorithm (Random Forest Classifier in this example)
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

    ## Train the algorithm on the training data

In this function, the `train_complex_algorithm` takes a file path (`training_data_path`) as input, assuming the path points to a CSV file containing mock training data. The function then loads the data, preprocesses it (assuming features and labels are included), splits it into training and testing sets, instantiates a Random Forest Classifier, trains the algorithm on the training data, and evaluates its accuracy using the testing data. Finally, the trained model is returned for later use.

This function provides a basic example of a complex machine learning algorithm training process, using a Random Forest Classifier as an illustrative example. The actual implementation and choice of algorithm may vary based on the specific requirements and data characteristics of the Autonomous Drone Navigation application.
