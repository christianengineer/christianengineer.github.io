### File Path: models/scikit-learn_models/model_training.py

```python
# models/scikit-learn_models/model_training.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Load mock data (example)
data = {
    'volunteer_experience': [0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1, 3],
    'hours_per_week': [3, 5, 7, 10, 4, 6, 2, 8, 5, 9],
    'matched_opportunity': [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Prepare features and target
X = df[['volunteer_experience', 'hours_per_week']]
y = df['matched_opportunity']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

# Generate a classification report
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

In this example, the script loads mock volunteer data, preprocesses the data, trains a RandomForest classifier using Scikit-Learn, and evaluates the model's performance using mock data. The code demonstrates a basic training workflow using Scikit-Learn.

This script can serve as a starting point for developing and training machine learning models using Scikit-Learn for the Volunteer Matching Platforms. It leverages mock data for demonstration purposes and can be further expanded and customized based on real data and model requirements.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script implementing a complex machine learning algorithm - a neural network using TensorFlow, for the Volunteer Matching Platforms. This example uses mock data for demonstration purposes.

### File Path: models/tensorflow_models/model_complex_algorithm.py

```python
# models/tensorflow_models/model_complex_algorithm.py

import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import numpy as np

# Generate mock data
np.random.seed(0)
X = np.random.rand(100, 5)  # Mock features
y = np.random.randint(2, size=100)  # Mock target variable

# Normalize the feature data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Build a neural network model using TensorFlow
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(5,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=16, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

In this example, the script generates mock feature and target data, normalizes the features, builds a neural network model using TensorFlow's Keras API, compiles the model, trains it on the mock data, and evaluates the model's performance.

This script can serve as a starting point for implementing a complex machine learning algorithm using TensorFlow for the Volunteer Matching Platforms.
