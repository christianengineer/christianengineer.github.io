## Objective
The objective of the AI Dynamic Food Packaging Optimization project in Peru is to develop a system that optimizes packaging processes for food products based on various factors such as product type, destination, and shelf life. The goal is to minimize waste and costs associated with packaging by leveraging AI and machine learning techniques.

## System Design Strategies
1. **Data Collection**: Gather data on product types, destinations, shelf life, packaging processes, and historical waste/cost information.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and transform the data using tools like Pandas to make it suitable for training machine learning models.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features such as product characteristics, shipping details, and shelf life to improve model performance.
4. **Model Selection**: Utilize Scikit-Learn to build machine learning models that can predict the optimal packaging processes for different scenarios.
5. **Integration**: Develop a web application using Flask to allow users to input their requirements and receive optimized packaging recommendations.
6. **Monitoring**: Implement Prometheus for monitoring system performance, data quality, and model accuracy to ensure continuous improvement.

## Chosen Libraries
1. **Scikit-Learn**: This library offers a wide range of machine learning algorithms and tools for model training, evaluation, and deployment.
2. **Pandas**: Ideal for data manipulation and analysis, Pandas can be used for cleaning, preprocessing, and transforming raw data into a usable format.
3. **Flask**: Flask is a lightweight web framework suitable for building web applications with Python, making it perfect for creating the user interface for our packaging optimization system.
4. **Prometheus**: For system monitoring and alerting, Prometheus provides a robust toolkit to track metrics and ensure the system is running efficiently.

By combining these libraries with sound system design strategies, the AI Dynamic Food Packaging Optimization project in Peru can achieve its goals of reducing waste and costs through intelligent packaging processes.
