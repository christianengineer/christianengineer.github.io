Certainly! Here's an example file for training a sentiment analysis model for the Elderly Care Companion Robots application using mock data:

### File: models/sentiment_analysis/train.py

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

## Load mock data for sentiment analysis
data_path = 'models/sentiment_analysis/data/processed/mock_sentiment_data.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(data_path)

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df['text'], df['label'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Preprocess text data using TF-IDF vectorization
tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000)
X_train_tfidf = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_tfidf = tfidf_vectorizer.transform(X_test)

## Train a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis
naive_bayes_clf = MultinomialNB()
naive_bayes_clf.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)

## Evaluate the trained model
y_pred = naive_bayes_clf.predict(X_test_tfidf)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Model trained with accuracy: {accuracy}")
print("Classification Report:")
print(report)
```

In this example, the file "train.py" is located at "models/sentiment_analysis/train.py" within the Elderly Care Companion Robots repository. The script loads mock sentiment analysis data from "models/sentiment_analysis/data/processed/mock_sentiment_data.csv", preprocesses the text data using TF-IDF vectorization, trains a Naive Bayes classifier, and evaluates the trained model using mock data.

This file demonstrates how machine learning models can be trained using Scikit-Learn and mock data within the Elderly Care Companion Robots application.

Certainly! Here's an example file for training a complex machine learning algorithm, such as a Random Forest classifier, for the Elderly Care Companion Robots application using mock data:

### File: models/complex_algorithm/train_complex_model.py

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

## Load mock data for the complex machine learning algorithm
data_path = 'models/complex_algorithm/data/processed/mock_complex_data.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(data_path)

## Separate features and target variable
X = df.drop('target', axis=1)
y = df['target']

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Initialize and train a Random Forest classifier
random_forest = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
random_forest.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Make predictions and evaluate the model
y_pred = random_forest.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Complex model trained with accuracy: {accuracy}")
print("Classification Report:")
print(report)
```

In this example, the file "train_complex_model.py" is located at "models/complex_algorithm/train_complex_model.py" within the Elderly Care Companion Robots repository. The script loads mock complex machine learning algorithm data from "models/complex_algorithm/data/processed/mock_complex_data.csv", prepares the data, trains a Random Forest classifier, and evaluates the trained model using mock data.
