from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import joblib

def train_fraud_detection_model(data_path, model_save_path):
    # Load mock data
    data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

    # Preprocessing steps (e.g., feature engineering, data cleaning, etc.)
    # ...

    # Split data into features and target variable
    X = data.drop(columns=['fraud_indicator'])
    y = data['fraud_indicator']

    # Split data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize machine learning model (RandomForestClassifier is used as an example)
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=5, random_state=42)

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Evaluate the model
    accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
    print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy}")

    # Save the trained model to the specified file path
