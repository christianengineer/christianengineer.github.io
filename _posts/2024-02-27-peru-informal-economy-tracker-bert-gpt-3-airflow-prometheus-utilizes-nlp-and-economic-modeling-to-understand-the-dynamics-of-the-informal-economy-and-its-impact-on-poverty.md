I would create a Python script for training a model of the Peru Informal Economy Tracker using mock data. Below is an example script named `train_model.py`:

```python
# train_model.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import joblib

# Load mock data
data_path = "data/mock_data.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

# Prepare data for training
X = data.drop(columns=['target_column'])
y = data['target_column']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
train_score = model.score(X_train, y_train)
test_score = model.score(X_test, y_test)

print(f"Training R^2 score: {train_score}")
print(f"Testing R^2 score: {test_score}")

# Save the trained model
model_path = "models/trained_model.pkl"
joblib.dump(model, model_path)

print("Model trained and saved successfully!")
```

### Explanation:
- The script loads mock data from a CSV file located at `"data/mock_data.csv"`.
- It trains a simple Linear Regression model on the mock data.
- The trained model is evaluated using the R^2 score on both the training and testing sets.
- The trained model is then saved as a pickle file at `"models/trained_model.pkl"`.

In this script, replace `"data/mock_data.csv"` with the actual file path of your mock data. After running this script, the trained model will be saved at `"models/trained_model.pkl"`.

I would create a Python script for implementing a complex machine learning algorithm for the Peru Informal Economy Tracker using mock data. Below is an example script named `complex_model.py`:

```python
# complex_model.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import joblib

# Load the mock data
data_path = "data/mock_data.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

# Feature engineering
# Add some more complex feature engineering processes here if needed

# Prepare data for training
X = data.drop(columns=['target_column'])
y = data['target_column']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Random Forest Regressor model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
train_preds = model.predict(X_train)
test_preds = model.predict(X_test)

train_mse = mean_squared_error(y_train, train_preds)
test_mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, test_preds)

print(f"Training Mean Squared Error: {train_mse}")
print(f"Testing Mean Squared Error: {test_mse}")

# Save the trained model
model_path = "models/complex_model.pkl"
joblib.dump(model, model_path)

print("Complex model trained and saved successfully!")
```

### Explanation:
- The script loads mock data from a CSV file located at `"data/mock_data.csv"`.
- It performs some feature engineering steps on the data (add more if needed).
- The script trains a RandomForestRegressor model on the mock data.
- The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error on both the training and testing sets.
- The trained model is saved as a pickle file at `"models/complex_model.pkl"`.

In this script, replace `"data/mock_data.csv"` with the actual file path of your mock data. After running this script, the trained complex model will be saved at `"models/complex_model.pkl"`.
