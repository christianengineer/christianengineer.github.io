title: AI Engineer needs to improve face recognition accuracy, solution is to use PyTorch and deep learning models to improve feature extraction and identification
---

The primary focus of this project should be on improving the accuracy of face recognition using PyTorch and deep learning models. By enhancing the feature extraction and identification processes, we aim to increase the precision and reliability of recognizing faces in various scenarios and conditions.

## Target Variable Name

A suitable target variable name for our model could be "Face Recognition Accuracy Score" (FRAS) as it encapsulates the main objective of the project - to measure the accuracy of the face recognition system.

## Importance of the Target Variable

The target variable, "Face Recognition Accuracy Score," is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of our deep learning model. It serves as a quantitative measure of how well the model performs in correctly identifying faces. By having a clear and measurable target variable, we can assess the impact of different model architectures, hyperparameters, and data preprocessing techniques on the overall accuracy of the face recognition system.

## Example Values and Decision Making

- **Example Values:**

  - Model A: FRAS = 85%
  - Model B: FRAS = 92%
  - Model C: FRAS = 78%

- **Decision Making:**
  - Based on these FRAS values, we can infer that Model B has the highest accuracy among the three models.
  - Users can make decisions on which model to deploy based on the FRAS values. For instance, if high accuracy is critical in a security system, they may choose Model B over the others.
  - Users can also analyze the factors that contributed to the differences in accuracy scores, such as the architecture of the models or the quality of training data, to further optimize the face recognition system.

By focusing on the "Face Recognition Accuracy Score" as the target variable, we can track the performance of our deep learning models and make informed decisions to enhance the accuracy of face recognition systems.

# Detailed Plan for Sourcing Data

# Secondary Target Variable: Facial Expression Recognition Accuracy

## Importance of the Secondary Target Variable

Introducing a secondary target variable, "Facial Expression Recognition Accuracy," can be crucial in enhancing our predictive model's accuracy and insights. By incorporating facial expression recognition alongside face recognition, the model's capability to understand emotions and context can be significantly improved.

## Example and Understanding of Values
