Certainly! Below is a Python function for a complex machine learning algorithm, specifically a Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning algorithm, that could be part of the decision-making module within the AutoDrive - Autonomous Vehicle AI System. This function uses mock data and is designed to train a DQN model for decision-making, given a set of observations and actions. The code is provided within a file named `dqn_algorithm.py`.

```python
# File: src/AI/decision_making/reinforcement_learning/dqn_algorithm.py

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from collections import deque

# Define the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm function
def train_dqn(observation_data, action_data):
    # Mock data dimensions
    num_observation_features = observation_data.shape[1]
    num_actions = action_data.shape[1]

    # Define the DQN model architecture
    model = Sequential([
        Dense(64, input_shape=(num_observation_features,), activation='relu'),
        Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        Dense(num_actions, activation='linear')
    ])

    # Compile the DQN model
    model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(lr=0.001))

    # DQN training parameters
    gamma = 0.95  # Discount factor
    epsilon = 1.0  # Exploration rate
    epsilon_min = 0.01
    epsilon_decay = 0.995
    memory = deque(maxlen=2000)  # Experience replay memory

    # DQN training loop
    for episode in range(num_episodes):
        state = observation_data[0]  # Initial state
        total_reward = 0
        for step in range(num_steps):
            if np.random.rand() <= epsilon:
                action = np.random.choice(num_actions)  # Explore: Choose random action
            else:
                action = np.argmax(model.predict(state.reshape(1, -1))[0])  # Exploit: Choose action from the Q-network

            next_state = observation_data[step]
            reward = 0  # Mock reward for demonstration
            done = False  # Mock termination signal for demonstration

            # Add the experience to the replay memory
            memory.append((state, action, reward, next_state, done))

            state = next_state
            total_reward += reward

            # Perform DQN training with mini-batch gradient descent

        # Decay exploration rate
        if epsilon > epsilon_min:
            epsilon *= epsilon_decay

    # Save the trained DQN model
    model.save('trained_dqn_model.h5')

    return model
```

In this example, the `train_dqn` function takes the observation data and action data as input and trains a DQN model using a mock training loop. The trained model is then saved to a file named `trained_dqn_model.h5`. This function would reside in the `src/AI/decision_making/reinforcement_learning/dqn_algorithm.py` file within the AutoDrive repository.

Certainly! Below is a Python function for a complex deep learning algorithm, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification, that could be part of the perception module within the AutoDrive - Autonomous Vehicle AI System. This function uses mock data and is designed to train a CNN model to classify images. The code is provided within a file named `cnn_algorithm.py`.

```python
# File: src/AI/perception/model_training/cnn_algorithm.py

import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Define the CNN algorithm function
def train_cnn(image_data, labels):
    # Mock data dimensions
    input_shape = image_data.shape[1:]  # Assuming shape (height, width, channels)
    num_classes = len(set(labels))

    # Preprocess the image data if necessary (e.g., normalization, resizing)

    # Define the CNN model architecture
    model = Sequential([
        Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
        MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
        Conv2D(64, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu'),
        MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
        Flatten(),
        Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
    ])

    # Compile the CNN model
    model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

    # Preprocess the labels if necessary (e.g., one-hot encoding)

    # CNN model training
    model.fit(image_data, labels, batch_size=32, epochs=10, validation_split=0.2)

    # Save the trained CNN model
    model.save('trained_cnn_model.h5')

    return model
```

In this example, the `train_cnn` function takes the image data and corresponding labels as input and trains a CNN model using a mock training process. The trained model is then saved to a file named `trained_cnn_model.h5`. This function would reside in the `src/AI/perception/model_training/cnn_algorithm.py` file within the AutoDrive repository.

The function can be further improved by adding data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.
