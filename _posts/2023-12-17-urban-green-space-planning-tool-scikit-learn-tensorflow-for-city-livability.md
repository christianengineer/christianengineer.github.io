# AI Urban Green Space Planning Tool

## Objectives
The AI Urban Green Space Planning Tool aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to aid city planners in optimizing the distribution and design of green spaces within urban environments. The primary objectives of the tool include:
- Analyzing existing urban layouts and environmental data to identify optimal locations for green spaces
- Predicting the impact of proposed green space layouts on city livability metrics such as air quality, temperature, and overall well-being
- Providing actionable insights for urban planners to enhance the quality of life in urban areas through strategically placed green spaces

## System Design Strategies
The system will employ a combination of machine learning models, data processing techniques, and interactive visualization components to achieve its objectives. The high-level design strategies include:
- Data Ingestion and Preprocessing: Acquiring and cleaning diverse datasets related to urban infrastructure, environmental factors, and livability indicators
- Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features from the input data to represent spatial and environmental characteristics
- Model Training and Inference: Developing predictive models using Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow to recommend optimal green space layouts and assess their impact
- Interactive Visualization: Building a user-friendly interface to visualize urban data, proposed green space layouts, and predicted livability metrics
- Scalability and Performance: Designing the system to handle large-scale urban data and deliver real-time insights for different city scenarios

## Chosen Libraries
To achieve the aforementioned system design strategies, the following libraries will be utilized:
- **Scikit-Learn**: This library provides a wide range of machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. It will be used for training predictive models to identify optimal green space locations and assess their impact on urban livability.
- **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow's capabilities in building and training deep learning models will be leveraged for more complex machine learning tasks, such as image recognition for assessing environmental factors and their impact on city livability.
- **Pandas**: Pandas will be used for data manipulation and preprocessing, allowing efficient handling of urban datasets and feature extraction.
- **Matplotlib and Plotly**: These visualization libraries will enable the creation of interactive and informative visualizations to present the urban data, proposed green space layouts, and predicted livability metrics to the end users.

By integrating these libraries within the AI Urban Green Space Planning Tool, we aim to build a scalable, data-intensive application that leverages the power of machine learning to enhance urban planning and livability.

Certainly! Below is an example Python script for training a machine learning model for the Urban Green Space Planning Tool using mock data. This script uses Scikit-Learn to train a simple regression model as an example. For the purpose of this example, the file will be named `train_model.py` and will be placed in the `models/model_training/` directory of the project:

File Path: `models/model_training/train_model.py`

```python
# models/model_training/train_model.py

# import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import joblib

# Load mock data (replace with actual data loading logic)
# Mock urban features
X = np.random.rand(100, 3)  # Mock feature matrix (100 samples, 3 features)
# Mock livability metrics
y = 2 * X[:, 0] - 3 * X[:, 1] + 5 * X[:, 2] + np.random.normal(scale=0.2, size=100)  # Mock target variable (livability metric)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error (MSE): {mse}")

# Save the trained model to a file for later use in deployment
model_filename = 'trained_regression_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, f'../trained_models/scikit-learn/{model_filename}')  # Save the trained model
print(f"Trained model saved as: {model_filename}")
```

In this script, we generate mock data for urban features and livability metrics. We then use Scikit-Learn to train a linear regression model on this mock data. After training, we evaluate the model's performance and save the trained model to a file using joblib. The model file is saved in the `trained_models/scikit-learn/` directory for later use in deployment.

This script serves as an example training workflow for the Urban Green Space Planning Tool and can be extended to use real urban and livability data to train more sophisticated machine learning models with Scikit-Learn or TensorFlow.

Certainly! Below is an example Python script for training a complex machine learning algorithm for the Urban Green Space Planning Tool using mock data. This script uses TensorFlow to build and train a simple neural network as an example. For the purpose of this example, the file will be named `train_complex_model.py` and will be placed in the `models/model_training/` directory of the project:

File Path: `models/model_training/train_complex_model.py`

```python
# models/model_training/train_complex_model.py

# import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import joblib

# Load mock data (replace with actual data loading logic)
# Mock urban features
X = np.random.rand(100, 3)  # Mock feature matrix (100 samples, 3 features)
# Mock livability metrics
y = 2 * X[:, 0] - 3 * X[:, 1] + 5 * X[:, 2] + np.random.normal(scale=0.2, size=100)  # Mock target variable (livability metric)

# Standardize the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Build a simple neural network using TensorFlow
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(3,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, validation_split=0.2, verbose=0)

# Evaluate the model
mse = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print(f"Mean Squared Error (MSE): {mse}")

# Save the trained model to files for later use in deployment
model.save('../trained_models/tensorflow/trained_neural_network_model.h5')  # Save the trained model
joblib.dump(scaler, '../trained_models/tensorflow/preprocessed_data/scaler.pkl')  # Save the scaler for preprocessing data
print("Trained model and scaler saved for TensorFlow")
```

In this script, we generate mock data for urban features and livability metrics. We then use TensorFlow to build and train a simple neural network on this mock data. After training, we evaluate the model's performance and save the trained model and the scaler used for preprocessing data to files for later use in deployment.
