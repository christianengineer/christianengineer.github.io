Below is an example of a Python script for training a BERT model for the Automated Fact-Checking Systems using mock data. This script assumes the availability of the BERT model implementation in the `models/bert/bert_model.py` file within the project structure.

```python
# train_bert_model.py
import torch
from models.bert.bert_model import BERTFactChecker
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from mock_data_loader import MockFactCheckingDataset  # Assuming existence of mock data loader

def train_bert_fact_checker(train_dataset_path, validation_dataset_path, batch_size=32, num_epochs=5):
    # Initialize BERT model
    bert_model = BERTFactChecker()  # Instantiate BERT model

    # Mock data loaders
    train_dataset = MockFactCheckingDataset(train_dataset_path)
    validation_dataset = MockFactCheckingDataset(validation_dataset_path)
    
    train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
    validation_loader = DataLoader(validation_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False)

    # Define loss function and optimizer
    criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(bert_model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

    # Training loop
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        bert_model.train()
        for data in train_loader:
            inputs, labels = data
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            outputs = bert_model(inputs)
            loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()

        # Validation
        bert_model.eval()
        with torch.no_grad():
            for data in validation_loader:
                inputs, labels = data
                outputs = bert_model(inputs)
                val_loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

        print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}, Validation Loss: {val_loss.item():.4f}')

    # Save trained model
    torch.save(bert_model.state_dict(), 'models/bert/saved_models/bert_trained_model.pth')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Paths to mock training and validation data
    train_data_path = 'data/mock_train_data.csv'
    validation_data_path = 'data/mock_validation_data.csv'

    # Train BERT fact-checking model
    train_bert_fact_checker(train_data_path, validation_data_path)
```

In this example, the `train_bert_model.py` script assumes the existence of mock data loader `mock_data_loader.py` and the BERT model implementation in `models/bert/bert_model.py`. The trained BERT model's state dictionary is saved in the `models/bert/saved_models/bert_trained_model.pth` file.

The `train_bert_fact_checker` function initializes and trains the BERT model using mock training and validation data, utilizing PyTorch for model training. The script can be executed to train the BERT model for fact-checking tasks using the provided mock data.

This script showcases a simplified training process using mock data and can be extended to incorporate more sophisticated model training techniques and real-world data.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script that demonstrates a complex machine learning algorithm for the Automated Fact-Checking Systems. This script assumes the existence of a complex model architecture that leverages BERT and GPT models for fact-checking tasks, along with the usage of mock data. Please note that the script is a simplified example and should be tailored to the specific needs of the application.

```python
# complex_fact_checking_model.py
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from transformers import BertModel, GPT2Model
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from mock_data_loader import MockFactCheckingDataset  # Assuming existence of a mock data loader

class ComplexFactCheckingModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ComplexFactCheckingModel, self).__init__()
        self.bert_model = BertModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
        self.gpt_model = GPT2Model.from_pretrained('gpt2')

        # Add additional layers for complex architecture
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(768, 256)  # Assuming BERT hidden size is 768
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(768, 256)  # Assuming GPT2 hidden size is 768
        self.output_layer = nn.Linear(256, 2)  # 2 classes for fact-checking (True/False)

    def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids):
        bert_output = self.bert_model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask, token_type_ids=token_type_ids).pooler_output
        gpt_output = self.gpt_model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask).last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1)

        # Complex architecture
        combined_features = torch.cat((bert_output, gpt_output), dim=1)
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(combined_features))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.output_layer(x)
        return x

def train_complex_fact_checker(train_dataset_path, validation_dataset_path, batch_size=32, num_epochs=5):
    # Initialize complex model
    complex_model = ComplexFactCheckingModel()

    # Mock data loaders
    train_dataset = MockFactCheckingDataset(train_dataset_path)
    validation_dataset = MockFactCheckingDataset(validation_dataset_path)
    
    train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
    validation_loader = DataLoader(validation_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False)

    # Define loss function and optimizer
    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(complex_model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

    # Training loop
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        complex_model.train()
        for data in train_loader:
            inputs, labels = data
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            outputs = complex_model(*inputs)  # Unpack inputs for BERT and GPT
            loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()

        # Validation
        complex_model.eval()
        with torch.no_grad():
            for data in validation_loader:
                inputs, labels = data
                outputs = complex_model(*inputs)  # Unpack inputs for BERT and GPT
                val_loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

        print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}, Validation Loss: {val_loss.item():.4f}')

    # Save trained model
    torch.save(complex_model.state_dict(), 'models/complex_trained_model.pth')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Paths to mock training and validation data
    train_data_path = 'data/mock_train_data.csv'
    validation_data_path = 'data/mock_validation_data.csv'

    # Train complex fact-checking model
    train_complex_fact_checker(train_data_path, validation_data_path)
```

In this example, the `complex_fact_checking_model.py` script defines a complex architecture that integrates BERT and GPT models for fact-checking tasks using a custom neural network. It utilizes PyTorch for the model definition, training, and evaluation. The script trains the complex fact-checking model using mock training and validation data.

The script assumes the existence of a mock data loader `mock_data_loader.py` and the usage of BERT and GPT models through `transformers` library. The trained complex model's state dictionary is saved in the `models/complex_trained_model.pth` file.

This script showcases a simplified demonstration of a complex architecture and can be further extended with additional model components and real-world data integration to meet the specific requirements of the Automated Fact-Checking Systems.
