Certainly! Below is a mock Python script for training a TensorFlow/Keras model for the Poverty Mapping AI application using mock data. This script assumes the presence of preprocessed mock data in an appropriate format for training the model. We'll name the file as `train_model.py` and assume the mock data is stored in a directory named `mock_data`.

```python
# train_model.py

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import numpy as np

# Load mock training data (replace with actual data loading code)
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 64, 64, 3)  # Replace with actual input data
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(100,))  # Replace with actual target labels

# Define the model architecture using Keras
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 3)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Assuming binary classification for simplicity
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',  # Assuming binary classification for simplicity
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

# Save the trained model
model.save('trained_model.h5')  # Save the trained model for deployment
```

In this script, we assume mock data is loaded into `X_train` and `y_train` as input features and target labels, respectively. The model architecture is defined using Keras sequential API, compiled with an optimizer and loss function, and then trained on the mock data. After training, the model is saved to a file named `trained_model.h5`.

To use this script, the mock data should be prepared and loaded appropriately before executing the training process. The `train_model.py` file should be placed within the `models/training/` directory of the Poverty Mapping AI application, alongside other training-related scripts and configuration files.

Please note that the mock data and model architecture used in this script are simplified for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, the data and model architecture would align with the actual requirements and characteristics of the Poverty Mapping AI application.

Certainly! Below is an example of a complex machine learning algorithm using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with TensorFlow and Keras. This example assumes the use of image data for poverty mapping and is designed to showcase a more intricate model architecture. We'll name the file as `complex_model.py` and assume the mock data is stored in a directory named `mock_data`.

```python
# complex_model.py

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import numpy as np

# Load mock training data (replace with actual data loading code)
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 128, 128, 3)  # Replace with actual input data
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(100,))  # Replace with actual target labels

# Define a complex CNN model architecture using Keras
model = models.Sequential([
    # Convolutional layers
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(128, 128, 3)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Flatten(),
    # Dense layers
    layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.5),  # Regularization
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.5),  # Regularization
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Assuming binary classification for simplicity
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',  # Assuming binary classification for simplicity
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

# Save the trained model
model.save('complex_trained_model.h5')  # Save the trained model for deployment
```

In this script, we define a more intricate CNN model for processing image data. The model includes multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dense layers, and includes dropout regularization for improved generalization. We compile the model with an optimizer and a loss function, and then train it on the mock image data. Lastly, the trained model is saved to a file named `complex_trained_model.h5`.

Similarly to the previous example, the mock data should be prepared and loaded appropriately before executing the training process. The `complex_model.py` file should be placed within the `models/training/` directory of the Poverty Mapping AI application, alongside other training-related scripts and configuration files.

This script provides a simple example of a more complex model architecture and is intended for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, the model architecture and data used would align with the actual requirements and characteristics of the Poverty Mapping AI application.
