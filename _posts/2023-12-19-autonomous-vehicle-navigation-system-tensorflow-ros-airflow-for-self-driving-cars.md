Certainly! Below is an example of a file for training a perception model of the Autonomous Vehicle Navigation System using TensorFlow with mock data.

**File Path:** `model_training/perception_training.py`

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from mock_data_loader import MockDataLoader
from perception_model import PerceptionModel
from perception_evaluation import evaluate_perception_model

## Load mock training data
data_loader = MockDataLoader()
train_data, train_labels = data_loader.load_training_data()

## Define the perception model
perception_model = PerceptionModel()
model = perception_model.build_model()

## Train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

## Evaluate the trained model
evaluation_results = evaluate_perception_model(model, test_data, test_labels)
print(evaluation_results)
```

In this example, the `perception_training.py` file uses mock data loaded through a `MockDataLoader` to train a perception model built with TensorFlow. The trained model is then evaluated using test data, and the evaluation results are printed.

This file aligns with the scalable file structure of the repository, specifically within the `model_training/` directory, and follows the modular design principles for training the perception model in the context of the Autonomous Vehicle Navigation System.

Certainly! Below is an example of a file for a complex machine learning algorithm, specifically a deep learning algorithm for decision-making, of the Autonomous Vehicle Navigation System using TensorFlow with mock data.

**File Path:** `model_training/decision_complex_algorithm.py`

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from mock_data_loader import MockDataLoader
from decision_model import DecisionModel
from decision_evaluation import evaluate_decision_model
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint, EarlyStopping

## Load mock training and validation data
data_loader = MockDataLoader()
train_data, train_labels = data_loader.load_training_data()
val_data, val_labels = data_loader.load_validation_data()

## Define the decision-making model
decision_model = DecisionModel()
model = decision_model.build_complex_model()

## Set up callbacks for model training
checkpoint = ModelCheckpoint('decision_model_checkpoint.h5', monitor='val_loss', save_best_only=True, mode='min', verbose=1)
early_stopping = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=5, verbose=1)

## Train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
history = model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=50, batch_size=64, validation_data=(val_data, val_labels), callbacks=[checkpoint, early_stopping])

## Evaluate the trained model
evaluation_results = evaluate_decision_model(model, test_data, test_labels)
print(evaluation_results)
```

In this example, the `decision_complex_algorithm.py` file demonstrates the training of a complex deep learning model for decision-making within the Autonomous Vehicle Navigation System, using TensorFlow with mock data. The model is trained with callbacks for model checkpointing and early stopping, and the evaluation results are printed.

This file follows the modular design principles and scalability of the repository's file structure, specifically within the `model_training/` directory, and reflects the integration of a complex machine learning algorithm for the decision-making component of the self-driving car application.
