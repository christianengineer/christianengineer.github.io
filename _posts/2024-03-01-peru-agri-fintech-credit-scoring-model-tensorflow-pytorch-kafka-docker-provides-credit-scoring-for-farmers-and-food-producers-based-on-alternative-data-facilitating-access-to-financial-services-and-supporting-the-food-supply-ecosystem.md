### Objectives:
- Develop a credit scoring model using alternative data sources for farmers and food producers in Peru.
- Facilitate access to financial services for underserved populations in the agriculture sector.
- Strengthen the food supply ecosystem by providing accurate credit assessments.

### System Design Strategies:
1. **Data Collection**: Gather alternative data sources such as crop yields, weather patterns, market prices, and farmers' socio-economic factors.
  
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean, transform, and standardize the data to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms.
  
3. **Model Development**: Utilize TensorFlow or PyTorch to build and train machine learning models for credit scoring.
  
4. **Scalability**: Use Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming and processing to handle large volumes of data efficiently.
  
5. **Containerization**: Docker can be utilized for packaging the application and its dependencies into containers, ensuring portability and easy deployment across different environments.

### Chosen Libraries:
1. **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Both are powerful deep learning frameworks that can be used for developing and training complex neural network models.
  
2. **Kafka**: Ideal for building scalable and fault-tolerant data pipelines to handle real-time data streams effectively.
  
3. **Docker**: Helps in packaging the application, along with its dependencies, into containers, ensuring consistency across different environments and simplifying deployment.

By implementing these strategies and leveraging the chosen libraries, we aim to build a scalable, data-intensive AI application that significantly improves access to financial services for farmers and food producers in Peru while supporting the food supply ecosystem.
