# Load the raw customer feedback data into a DataFrame
data = pd.read_csv('customer_feedback_data.csv')

# Define custom stopwords relevant to customer feedback analysis
custom_stopwords = set(stopwords.words('english')) | {'peru', 'rappi', 'feedback_specific_term'}

# Initialize WordNet Lemmatizer for text normalization
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

# Preprocessing Steps
for index, row in data.iterrows():
    # Step 1: Lowercasing and removing special characters
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\s]', '', str(row['text'])).lower()
    
    # Step 2: Tokenization and removing stopwords
    tokens = word_tokenize(text)
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in custom_stopwords]
    
    # Step 3: Lemmatization for word normalization
    tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(token) for token in tokens]
    
    # Step 4: Concatenating tokens back into preprocessed text
    processed_text = ' '.join(tokens)
    
    # Update the 'text' column with preprocessed text
    data.at[index, 'text'] = processed_text
