### Objectives:
The objective of AI text summarization with Hugging Face Transformers is to condense large text documents or repositories into shorter summaries while preserving the key information and context. This can improve information retrieval, aid in quick understanding of large volumes of text, and enable automated processing of large amounts of data.

### System Design Strategies:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and tokenize the input text data, removing irrelevant information and preparing it for the summarization model.
2. **Model Selection**: Choose a suitable pre-trained language model from Hugging Face Transformers, such as BERT, GPT-2, or T5, that is well-suited for text summarization.
3. **Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune the selected model on a summarization dataset or domain-specific data to enhance its ability to produce accurate and concise summaries.
4. **Scalability**: Design the system to handle large volumes of text data by leveraging distributed computing or parallel processing if necessary.
5. **API Integration**: Integrate the text summarization model into an API for easy access and usage in downstream applications.

### Chosen Libraries:
1. **Hugging Face Transformers**: Use this library to leverage pre-trained language models for text summarization. It provides a wide range of state-of-the-art models and tools for natural language processing tasks.
2. **PyTorch or TensorFlow**: Depending on the compatibility and pre-trained models available, choose the appropriate deep learning framework for implementing the text summarization model.
3. **Flask or FastAPI**: Use these web frameworks to build an API that exposes the text summarization functionality for easy integration into other systems.
4. **NLTK or SpaCy**: These libraries can be utilized for text preprocessing, including tokenization, removing stop words, and other text cleaning tasks.
5. **Distributed Computing Framework (e.g., Dask, Apache Spark)**: If scalability is a concern, consider integrating a distributed computing framework to handle large-scale text summarization tasks efficiently.

By employing these system design strategies and utilizing the chosen libraries, the AI text summarization system can effectively process large text documents and repositories, delivering concise and relevant summaries.

By structuring these deployment-related resources in a dedicated directory, the application's deployment process becomes more organized, modular, and reproducible across different environments.

```python
import os
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
import torch

def summarize_text(input_text, model_path, tokenizer_path):
    ## Load pre-trained T5 model and tokenizer
    tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(tokenizer_path)
    model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_path)

    ## Tokenize the input text
    input_ids = tokenizer.encode("summarize: " + input_text, return_tensors="pt", max_length=512, truncation=True)

    ## Generate the summary
    summary_ids = model.generate(input_ids, num_beams=4, max_length=150, min_length=30, early_stopping=True)
    summary = tokenizer.decode(summary_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

    return summary

## Mock data
input_text = "Mock input text for summarization. This could be a large document with multiple paragraphs."

## Replace these paths with actual paths to the pre-trained model and tokenizer on your local system
model_path = "path_to_pretrained_model"
tokenizer_path = "path_to_tokenizer"

## Call the function with mock data
summary = summarize_text(input_text, model_path, tokenizer_path)
print(summary)
```

In the above Python code, I have encapsulated the text summarization functionality within the `summarize_text` function. The function takes the input text, pre-trained model path, and tokenizer path as input parameters. It utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library to load the T5 model and tokenizer, tokenize the input text, and generate a summary using the loaded model. The function returns the generated summary.

You would need to replace the 'path_to_pretrained_model' and 'path_to_tokenizer' with the actual file paths to the pre-trained model and tokenizer on your local system.

When you call the `summarize_text` function with the mock input data, it will generate a summary using the specified pre-trained model.

```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration

def summarize_text(input_text, model_path, tokenizer_path):
    ## Load pre-trained T5 model and tokenizer
    tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(tokenizer_path)
    model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_path)

    ## Tokenize the input text
    inputs = tokenizer.encode("summarize: " + input_text, return_tensors="pt", max_length=1024, truncation=True)

    ## Generate the summary
    summary_ids = model.generate(inputs, num_beams=4, max_length=150, min_length=30, early_stopping=True)
    summary = tokenizer.decode(summary_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

    return summary

## Mock data
input_text = "Mock input text for summarization. This could be a large document with multiple paragraphs."

## Replace these paths with actual paths to the pre-trained model and tokenizer on your local system
model_path = "path_to_pretrained_model"
tokenizer_path = "path_to_tokenizer"

## Call the function with mock data
summary = summarize_text(input_text, model_path, tokenizer_path)
print(summary)
```

In this Python code, I have created the `summarize_text` function using the Hugging Face Transformers library to implement text summarization. The function takes the input text, pre-trained model path, and tokenizer path as input parameters. It loads the T5 model and tokenizer, tokenizes the input text, generates a summary using the model, and returns the generated summary.

Please replace the 'path_to_pretrained_model' and 'path_to_tokenizer' with the actual file paths to the pre-trained model and tokenizer on your local system. When you call the `summarize_text` function with the mock input data, it will generate a summary using the specified pre-trained model.
