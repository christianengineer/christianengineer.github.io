    # Fill missing 'skills' with unknown
    resume_df['skills'].fillna('unknown', inplace=True)
    return resume_df

def correct_class_imbalance(resume_df):
    # Upsample minority classes in 'job_category' to address class imbalance
    minority_class = resume_df['job_category'].value_counts().idxmin()
    minority_df = resume_df[resume_df['job_category'] == minority_class]
    majority_df = resume_df[resume_df['job_category'] != minority_class]
    minority_upsampled = resample(minority_df, replace=True, n_samples=len(majority_df), random_state=42)
    balanced_resume_df = pd.concat([majority_df, minority_upsampled])
    return balanced_resume_df

def text_filtering(text):
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    # Remove stop words from text
    filtered_text = ' '.join(word for word in text.split() if word not in stop_words)
    return filtered_text

def anonymize_data(resume_df):
    # Anonymize sensitive information in 'name' and 'email' columns
    resume_df['name'] = resume_df['name'].apply(lambda x: 'Anonymous' if pd.notna(x) else x)
    resume_df['email'] = resume_df['email'].apply(lambda x: 'example@example.com' if pd.notna(x) else x)
    return resume_df

# Main function to cleanse the resume data
def cleanse_resume_data(file_path):
    resume_df = load_resume_data(file_path)
    
    # Data cleansing steps
    resume_df['text'] = resume_df['text'].apply(text_normalization)
    resume_df['text'] = resume_df['text'].apply(entity_recognition)
    resume_df = handle_missing_data(resume_df)
    resume_df = correct_class_imbalance(resume_df)
    resume_df['text'] = resume_df['text'].apply(text_filtering)
    resume_df = anonymize_data(resume_df)
    
    return resume_df

# Example: Run data cleansing on 'resume_data.csv'
cleaned_resume_data = cleanse_resume_data('resume_data.csv')
```

3. The `COPY . /app` line copies the current directory contents into the `/app` directory in the container.
4. The `RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /app/requirements.txt` command installs the necessary Python packages specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
5. The `ENV` commands set environment variables for Python to improve performance.
6. The `EXPOSE 5000` line exposes port 5000 to allow communication with the outside world.
7. The `CMD ["python", "app.py"]` command specifies the command to run the application (`app.py`) when the container starts.

### Instructions:
1. **Optimize Dependencies**: Ensure the `requirements.txt` file includes only necessary dependencies for optimal performance.
2. **Efficient Resource Usage**: Monitor and adjust resource allocation (CPU, memory) for the container according to performance needs.
3. **Buffering and Caching**: Enable Python unbuffered mode (`PYTHONUNBUFFERED=TRUE`) and disable bytecode generation (`PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=TRUE`) for improved performance.
4. **Port Exposure**: Expose the port used by the application to allow external access and communication.

This Dockerfile provides a robust container setup tailored to your project's performance requirements, optimizing dependencies, resource usage, buffering, and port exposure for efficient and scalable deployment of the NLP-powered AI resume screening system.
