The Machine Learning for Music Composition repository is a web-based application that uses machine learning techniques to compose music. It aims to provide users with a platform where they can generate unique and personalized music compositions based on their preferences. The application handles both the training and inference phases of the machine learning models and focuses on efficient data management and the ability to handle high user traffic.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of the Machine Learning for Music Composition repository are:
1. Efficient Data Management: The application needs to handle large amounts of musical data efficiently for training the machine learning models. It should be able to organize, preprocess, and store data in a manner that optimizes training performance and minimizes storage requirements.
2. Scalability: The system should be able to handle high user traffic without compromising performance. It should be capable of scaling horizontally to accommodate a large number of concurrent users.
3. Real-time Inference: The application should provide real-time music composition capabilities to users, allowing them to generate compositions on the fly.
4. Model Performance: The machine learning models used in the application should be optimized for accuracy and efficiency. The system should incorporate models that can generate high-quality music compositions within acceptable time limits.

## Chosen Libraries

### TensorFlow
Library Website: [https://www.tensorflow.org/](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

TensorFlow is chosen as the primary machine learning library for the repository. It offers a comprehensive set of tools and functionalities for building and training deep learning models, which is crucial for the music composition task. Its high-level APIs, such as Keras, provide ease of use and abstraction, making it easier to experiment and iterate on different model architectures. TensorFlow's tensor computation and optimization capabilities ensure efficient training and inference on large datasets.

Tradeoffs:
- TensorFlow has a steep learning curve for beginners due to its complex API and concepts. However, since the assumed reader is an expert with the library, this is not a significant concern.
- TensorFlow's heavyweight nature may lead to longer training times and increased resource utilization. Careful optimization and utilization of distributed computing may be required to mitigate these issues.

### Flask
Library Website: [https://flask.palletsprojects.com/](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)

Flask is chosen as the web framework for the application due to its simplicity, flexibility, and scalability. It is a lightweight framework that allows the development of RESTful APIs with minimal overhead. Flask enables efficient handling of HTTP requests, making it suitable for high user traffic scenarios. Its modular design and extensive ecosystem provide a wide range of extensions and libraries to integrate with other components of the application.

Tradeoffs:
- Flask may require more manual configuration compared to other web frameworks like Django. However, this tradeoff is acceptable as it allows for greater control and customization.
- Since Flask is a micro-framework, additional libraries may be necessary for handling specific requirements, such as authentication or database integration. These libraries need to be carefully selected to ensure their compatibility with Flask and the overall performance of the application.

### Redis
Library Website: [https://redis.io/](https://redis.io/)

Redis is chosen as the in-memory data store for efficient data management and caching. It provides fast key-value storage and support for advanced data structures, allowing efficient retrieval and caching of frequently accessed data. Redis' simplicity and performance make it an ideal choice for handling large amounts of musical data during training and inference.

Tradeoffs:
- Redis is an in-memory database, which means it does not persist data to disk by default. Proper data backup strategies or additional disk persistence configurations may be necessary to prevent data loss.
- Support for complex queries and data manipulation in Redis is limited compared to more traditional databases. However, since the main purpose of Redis in this application is caching and efficient data retrieval, this tradeoff can be mitigated.

## Conclusion
By utilizing TensorFlow for machine learning tasks, Flask for web development, and Redis for data management, the Machine Learning for Music Composition repository will be capable of efficiently handling large datasets, scaling to accommodate high user traffic, providing real-time music composition capabilities, and optimizing model performance. Careful consideration of the tradeoffs associated with each library will ensure that the chosen technologies meet the objectives of the application effectively.

class CoreLogic:
    def __init__(self, model_path):
        self.model = MusicCompositionModel(model_path)
    
    def compose_music(self, input_sequences):
        # Preprocess input_sequences
        preprocessed_input = preprocess_data(input_sequences)
        
        # Use the Machine Learning model to generate music

        return postprocessed_music

# Create an instance of CoreLogic class

core_logic = CoreLogic(model_path='models/model_1')

# Example usage:
input_sequences = ...
composed_music = core_logic.compose_music(input_sequences)
```

The `core_logic.py` file is located in the `src` directory of the project's file structure. It imports the required libraries, including TensorFlow, and the necessary modules from the `models` and `utils` directories of the project.
