```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def complex_machine_learning_algorithm(data_path):
    ## Load mock social media data from the specified file path
    social_media_data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

    ## Preprocessing steps (e.g., feature engineering, data cleaning, and encoding)

    ## Split the data into features and target variable
    X = social_media_data.drop('target', axis=1)
    y = social_media_data['target']

    ## Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
