Training a machine learning model for Automated Quality Inspection in Manufacturing typically involves creating a script to load and preprocess mock image data, training the model using OpenCV for image processing, TensorFlow or PyTorch for machine learning, and potentially using RabbitMQ for messaging. Below is an example of a Python script for training a mock model:

Filename: `train_model.py`

```python
import os
import numpy as np
import cv2
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

## Define the path to the mock dataset
dataset_path = '/path/to/mock_dataset/'

## Define parameters for image dimensions and classes
img_width, img_height = 128, 128
num_classes = 2

## Load mock dataset
def load_dataset(path):
    images = []
    labels = []
    for label in os.listdir(path):
        label_path = os.path.join(path, label)
        for image_file in os.listdir(label_path):
            image_path = os.path.join(label_path, image_file)
            image = cv2.imread(image_path)
            image = cv2.resize(image, (img_width, img_height))
            images.append(image)
            labels.append(int(label))  ## Assuming class folders are labeled as 0 and 1
    return np.array(images), np.array(labels)

## Load mock data
X, y = load_dataset(dataset_path)

## Preprocess data (e.g., normalization, train/test split)
## ...

## Define and compile the model architecture
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(img_width, img_height, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model using the mock data
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

## Save the trained model
model.save('/path/to/save/trained_model.h5')
```

In this example, the `train_model.py` script loads mock image data from a specified directory, preprocesses the data, defines and compiles a simple convolutional neural network model using TensorFlow, and then trains the model with the mock data. The trained model is then saved to a specified path.

For a real-world application, the mock data directory should be replaced with the actual dataset path, and the model architecture and training process should be tailored to the specific requirements of the Automated Quality Inspection system. Additionally, integration with RabbitMQ messaging or Kubernetes deployment may be required, depending on the system architecture.

Creating a complex machine learning algorithm for quality control in manufacturing involves developing a robust model tailored to the specific requirements of defect detection and quality inspection. The following Python script demonstrates the development of a more complex convolutional neural network (CNN) model using TensorFlow for this purpose:

Filename: `complex_machine_learning_algorithm.py`

```python
import os
import numpy as np
import cv2
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

## Define the path to the mock dataset
dataset_path = '/path/to/mock_dataset/'

## Load and preprocess mock dataset
def load_dataset(path):
    images = []
    labels = []
    for label in os.listdir(path):
        label_path = os.path.join(path, label)
        for image_file in os.listdir(label_path):
            image_path = os.path.join(label_path, image_file)
            image = cv2.imread(image_path)
            image = cv2.resize(image, (128, 128))  ## Resize images to a standardized size
            images.append(image)
            labels.append(int(label))  ## Assuming class folders are labeled as 0 and 1
    return np.array(images), np.array(labels)

X, y = load_dataset(dataset_path)

## Preprocess data (e.g., normalization, train/test split)
X = X / 255.0  ## Normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Define and compile a complex CNN model
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(128, 128, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  ## Binary classification (defective/non-defective)
])

model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.0001), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the complex model using the mock data
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=15, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

## Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Model evaluation - Loss: {loss}, Accuracy: {accuracy}')

## Save the trained model
model.save('/path/to/save/trained_complex_model.h5')
```

In this script, a more complex CNN model is defined using TensorFlow's Keras API to handle quality inspection in manufacturing. The model consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers, as well as dropout regularization. It is then trained and evaluated using the mock dataset. The trained model is subsequently saved to a specified path.

When working with real-world data, it's crucial to replace the mock dataset path with the actual dataset and tailor the model structure, hyperparameters, and evaluation based on the specific requirements and characteristics of the Automated Quality Inspection system. Furthermore, integration with the RabbitMQ messaging system or Kubernetes deployment, if relevant, would also be incorporated into the application.
