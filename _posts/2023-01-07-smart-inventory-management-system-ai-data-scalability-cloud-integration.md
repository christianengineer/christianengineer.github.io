# Smart Inventory Management System

## Description

The Smart Inventory Management System is a robust system designed to streamline inventory tracking and data analytics. As businesses grow, managing inventory can become a complex task. Our system is designed with scalability in mind, offering a seamless management tool that evolves with your business. This system gives you real-time tracking of inventory, sales, orders, and client relationships, offering an all-in-one solution for businesses of all sizes.

## Goals

The main goals for the Smart Inventory Management System are:

- Streamline and automate the inventory management process.
- Provide real-time updates and accurate tracking of inventory.
- Offer insightful data analytics on demand trends, sales, and inventory consumption.
- Be easily scalable to handle a growing business’s changing needs.
- Improve cost-effective decision-making and forecasting through accurate data.
  
## Key Features
  
- **Real-time Inventory Management:** The system offers real-time tracking and updates of stock levels, ensuring businesses have a clear and accurate view of inventory status.

- **Sales and Order Tracking:** Integrated with the sales system, it offers a clear overview of sales trends, client orders, and shipping status.

- **Data Analytics:** The system is integrated with a robust data analytics engine, providing accurate insights.

- **Scalability:** Designed with scalability as a need, it can be adapted to businesses of all sizes, from startups to large corporations. 

## Process Flow 
  
- Inventory Update: The system will constantly keep track of the inventory based on the incoming and outgoing stocks.
- Sales Tracking: Interfacing with your sales software to keep track of all completed sales transactions.
- Orders Tracking: Keeps track of all pending, completed or cancelled orders, and auto-updates the inventory respectively.
- Data Analysis: Constantly analyzing data to provide insights, forecasts and trends.
  
## Libraries to be Used 

Using the right libraries ensures efficient data handling and scalable user traffic:

- **Express.js:** As part of the Node.js framework, Express JS will be used to build the backend of the application because it is fast, unopinionated, and very flexible.

- **React.js:** It will be used to build the user interface components. The major reason being its efficiency and flexibility. It also aids in creating large web applications.

- **Redux:** Managing the state of the application will be done using Redux. It makes it easier to manage the state of your application in one single place and update this state based on different actions.

- **MongoDB:** As an open-source NoSQL database, It's perfect for handling large amounts of data and complexity.

- **Mongoose:** Mongoose makes MongoDB even easier by providing straight-forward, schema-based modeling for your data.

These libraries have been chosen for their capability to provide secure, scalable, and fast processing, ensuring efficient data handling and scalable user traffic. They are all well maintained and supported libraries, ensuring our system remains up-to-date and secure.

Markdown format may not be the best choice for visualizing a file hierarchy in large repositories, so here's a text representation:

``` 

Each directory is organized in such a way as to group related files, ensuring efficient navigation and scalability as the system requirements grow. 

- The client-side "components" includes files for each component like Dashboard, Inventory, Sales, Orders, and Analytics.
- The server-side "routes" includes the server routing and "models" contains MongoDB database schema definitions.
- The "database" directory includes files related to the database connection and manipulation.
- The "test" directory contains organized client and server testing files.
- The root directory contains configuration, package definitions and general files like README and .gitignore.

The handling logic for the Smart Inventory Management System will likely be split across multiple files, but a crucial one would be the server-side route that interfaces with the inventory database. Below is a fictitious handler file written in Express.js that interacts with a MongoDB database, named `inventory.js`, located in `/server/routes/`.

```javascript
/**
* /server/routes/inventory.js
*/

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const Inventory = require('../models/Inventory');

// Get all inventory items
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const items = await Inventory.find();
    res.json(items);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: err.message });
  }
});

// Get one inventory item
router.get('/:id', getInventory, (req, res) => {
  res.json(res.inventory);
});

// Create one inventory item
router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
  const item = new Inventory({
    name: req.body.name,
    quantity: req.body.quantity
  });

  try {
    const newItem = await item.save();
    res.status(201).json(newItem);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(400).json({ message: err.message });
  }
});

// Update one inventory item
router.patch('/:id', getInventory, async (req, res) => {
  if (req.body.name != null) {
    res.inventory.name = req.body.name;
  }

  if (req.body.quantity != null) {
    res.inventory.quantity = req.body.quantity;
  }

  try {
    const updatedItem = await res.inventory.save();
    res.json(updatedItem);
  } catch {
    res.status(400).json({ message: err.message });
  }
});

// Middleware function for getting inventory by ID
async function getInventory(req, res, next) {
  let inventory;
  try {
    inventory = await Inventory.findById(req.params.id);
    if (inventory == null) {
      return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Cannot find item' });
    }
  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(500).json({ message: err.message });
  }

  res.inventory = inventory;
  next();
}

module.exports = router;
```

This file declares routes for various actions such as getting items, adding new items and updating existing ones in the inventory. Logic for handling requests is expressed as middleware functions with clear error handling. The `getInventory` function as an example of reusable middleware to fetch an inventory item by its ID.
