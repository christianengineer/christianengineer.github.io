Below is a Python script for training a model for the Peru Fishery Stock Management System using mock data. The script uses Keras, TensorFlow, and DVC for model training and version control.

```python
# File Path: src/train_model.py

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import dvc.api

# Load mock satellite and sonar data using DVC
data_url = 'dvc://data/mock_fishery_data.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(data_url)

# Separate features and target variable
X = data.drop(columns=['fish_stock_level'])
y = data['fish_stock_level']

# Split the data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define a simple neural network model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='linear')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))

# Save the trained model
model.save('models/trained_model.h5')
```

This script loads mock fishery data from a CSV file using DVC, preprocesses the data, trains a neural network model using Keras and TensorFlow, and saves the trained model to the `models/` directory as `trained_model.h5`.

You can run this script to train the model using mock data for the Peru Fishery Stock Management System.

Below is a Python script for implementing a complex machine learning algorithm, such as a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), for the Peru Fishery Stock Management System using mock data. The script utilizes Spark for distributed processing and DVC for data version control.

```python
# File Path: src/complex_ml_algorithm.py

from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
from pyspark.ml.regression import GBTRegressor
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import RegressionEvaluator
import dvc.api

# Create a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("PeruFisheryStockManagement").getOrCreate()

# Load mock satellite and sonar data using DVC
data_url = 'dvc://data/mock_fishery_data.csv'
data = spark.read.csv(data_url, header=True, inferSchema=True)

# Feature engineering and preparation
feature_cols = [col for col in data.columns if col != 'fish_stock_level']
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol='features')
assembled_data = assembler.transform(data)

# Split the data into training and validation sets
train_data, val_data = assembled_data.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2], seed=42)

# Train a Gradient Boosting Machine model
gbm = GBTRegressor(featuresCol='features', labelCol='fish_stock_level')
gbm_model = gbm.fit(train_data)

# Make predictions on the validation set
predictions = gbm_model.transform(val_data)

# Evaluate the model
evaluator = RegressionEvaluator(labelCol='fish_stock_level', predictionCol='prediction', metricName='rmse')
rmse = evaluator.evaluate(predictions)

# Save the model
model_path = 'models/gbm_model'
gbm_model.save(model_path)

# Print the RMSE score
print(f'Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of the GBM model: {rmse}')

# Stop the Spark session
spark.stop()
```

In this script, we utilize a Gradient Boosting Machine algorithm implemented in Spark to train a model for predicting fish stock levels. The script loads mock data using DVC, performs feature engineering, trains the GBM model, evaluates its performance, and saves the trained model to the `models/` directory as `gbm_model`.

You can run this script to apply a complex machine learning algorithm to the Peru Fishery Stock Management System using mock data.
