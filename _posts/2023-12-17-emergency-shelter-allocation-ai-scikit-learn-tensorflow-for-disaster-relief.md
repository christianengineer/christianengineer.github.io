Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a simple linear regression model using Scikit-Learn with mock data. This script creates mock data, trains a linear regression model, and then saves the trained model to a file using joblib serialization.

```python
# File path: src/model_training/train_linear_regression_model.py

import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import joblib

# Create mock data for training
X = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 3]])
y = np.dot(X, np.array([1, 2])) + 3
# Mock data represents features (X) and target labels (y)

# Initialize and train the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Save the trained model to a file
model_file_path = 'models/scikit-learn/regression/linear_regression_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, model_file_path)

print(f"Linear regression model trained and saved to {model_file_path}")
```

Let's discuss further the integration of this training process with the overall development workflow and the considerations for handling real data during model training.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a complex machine learning algorithm, specifically a deep learning model using TensorFlow, with mock data. This script creates mock data, defines and trains a simple neural network model, and then saves the trained model using the SavedModel format.

```python
# File path: src/model_training/train_deep_learning_model.py

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Create mock data for training
X = np.random.rand(100, 3)
y = np.random.randint(2, size=(100, 1))
# Mock data represents features (X) and target labels (y)

# Define a simple neural network model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='relu', input_shape=(3,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y, epochs=50, batch_size=32)

# Save the trained model in SavedModel format
model.save('models/tensorflow/deep_learning/saved_model/1')

print("Deep learning model trained and saved using TensorFlow SavedModel format")
```

In this example, the file `train_deep_learning_model.py` resides within the `src/model_training` directory of the Emergency Shelter Allocation AI repository. The script generates mock data, defines and trains a simple neural network model using TensorFlow, and then saves the trained model in the TensorFlow SavedModel format within the specified directory (e.g., `models/tensorflow/deep_learning/saved_model/1`).
