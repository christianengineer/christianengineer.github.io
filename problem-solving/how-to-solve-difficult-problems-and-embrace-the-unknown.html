    <h1>How to solve complex problems and embrace the unknown</h1>
    <p>Are you currently struggling with a complex problem?</p>
    <p>My first step is to answer these questions:</p>
    <h2>Step 1: Define the Problem and Impact</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>What does the solution look like?</li>
        <li>Where, what, or whom does this solution impact?</li>
        <li>What can you learn from the journey while arriving at this solution?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once you answer the 3rd question, you will notice the benefits you will receive by working
        towards a solution. The thought of giving up has faded.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Identify the Next Physical Action</h2>
    <p>Lets now begin:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pick one of the things you listed for question 3.</li>
        <li>Now answer this question: <strong>What physical action can I take to make the slightest progress?</strong>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>These examples include the following physical action that can be taken toward completing it.</p>
    <h3>To Learn JavaScript</h3>
    <p>Follow these physical actions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>With your hand, move your mouse cursor to your preferred browser icon.</li>
        <li>Press your mouse button to click and open a new browser window.</li>
        <li>Place your fingers on the keyboard.</li>
        <li>Type "How to print hello world in JavaScript" into the browser's search field.</li>
        <li>Press the 'Enter' key with your finger to initiate the search.</li>
        <li>Navigate to a Relevant Tutorial or Guide:</li>
        <li>Move your mouse cursor to a link with a suitable tutorial or guide.</li>
        <li>Click on the link to open the page.</li>
        <li>Read the Instructions on Printing "Hello, World!" in JavaScript:</li>
        <li>Move your eyes across the screen to read the instructions.</li>
        <li>Follow along with any code examples or explanations provided.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>To Learn DevOps</h3>
    <p>Follow these physical actions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>With your hand, move your mouse cursor to your preferred browser icon.</li>
        <li>Press your mouse button to click and open a new browser window.</li>
        <li>Place your fingers on the keyboard.</li>
        <li>Type "DevOps Categories" into the search field of the browser.</li>
        <li>Press the 'Enter' key with your finger to initiate the search.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 3: Continue Making Progress</h2>
    <p>After you complete the first physical action, repeat the same question but slightly differently:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What is the following physical action I can take to keep progressing?</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>You are now determined to solve your problem by being physically engaged in progressing toward a solution.</p>

    <p>Your actions will inspire others through actions.</p>

    <p><strong>Your commitment will contribute positively to any team.</strong></p>
