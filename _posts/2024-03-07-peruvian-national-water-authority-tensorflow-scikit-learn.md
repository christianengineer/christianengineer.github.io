## Define preprocessing steps for different types of features
numeric_features = ['temperature', 'precipitation']
numeric_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')),  ## Impute missing values with mean
    ('scaler', StandardScaler())  ## Standardize numerical features
])

categorical_features = ['season', 'day_of_week']
