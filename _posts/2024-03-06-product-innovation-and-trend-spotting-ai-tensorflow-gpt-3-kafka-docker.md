2. **Dependency Installation:**
   - Installs project dependencies from `requirements.txt` for the Flask application.
3. **File Copying:**
   - Copies the trained model (`model.joblib`) and Flask application script (`app.py`) into the container.
4. **Environment Setup:**
   - Sets the Flask app file to run as `app.py`.
5. **Port Configuration:**
   - Exposes port 5000 to allow communication with the Flask application.
6. **Command Execution:**
   - Commands to run the Flask application when the container starts.

### Performance and Scalability Considerations:
- **Dependency Optimization:** Minimizes cache files (`--no-cache-dir`) to streamline dependency installation and reduce container build time.
- **Environment Management:** Sets up a clean working directory for the Flask application to enhance performance and avoid conflicts.
- **Port Exposition:** Exposes port 5000 for communication, facilitating external connections and scalability.
- **Flask Execution:** Runs the Flask application with `--host=0.0.0.0` to ensure proper accessibility and scalability within the production environment.

By utilizing this optimized Dockerfile configuration designed for your project's performance needs, you can create a robust container setup that encapsulates the model, dependencies, and Flask application, ensuring optimal performance and scalability for your specific project use case in a production environment.
