      <p>
        Setting up a scalable GraphQL repository for a large tech company,
        especially one with over 100 applications, can be a daunting task.
        However, with the right approach, this task becomes more manageable.
        This article will guide you on how to set up an effective, scalable

      <h2>Folder Structure</h2>
      <pre>
/graphql-repo
  /applications
    /app1
      /src
      /test
    /app2
      /src

  /tools
    /migration
    /seeding
  /docs
        </pre
      >
      <p>
        In this structure, each application has its own directory under the
        <code>/applications</code> directory. Each application directory
        contains a <code>/src</code> folder for source files and a
        <code>/test</code> folder for test files.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>/common</code> directory is where shared resources like
        schemas and resolvers are stored. The <code>/tools</code> directory
        contains tools for database migration and seeding. The
        <code>/docs</code> directory is for storing documentation.

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Why GraphQL?</dt>
        <dd>
          GraphQL offers a more efficient data-fetching than traditional REST.
          It allows clients to specify exactly what data they need, reducing the
          amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network.
        </dd>
        <dt>What is the /common directory for?</dt>
        <dd>
          The /common directory is for shared resources like schemas and
          resolvers. These are resources that are used by multiple applications.
        </dd>
        <dt>What are the /migration and /seeding directories for?</dt>
        <dd>
          These directories contain tools for database migration and seeding.
          Migration scripts are used to update your database schema, while
          seeding scripts are used to populate your database with initial data.
