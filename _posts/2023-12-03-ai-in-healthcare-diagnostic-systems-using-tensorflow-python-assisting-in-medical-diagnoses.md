Sure, below is a Python function for a complex machine learning algorithm using TensorFlow to perform medical image classification. This function takes mock medical image data as input and uses a pre-trained deep learning model to make predictions on the provided images.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

## Define the file path for the pre-trained model
model_file_path = 'models/trained_models/image_diagnosis_model/'

def perform_image_classification(image_data):
    """
    Performs medical image classification using a pre-trained deep learning model.

    Args:
    - image_data: A numpy array representing the medical image data.

    Returns:
    - predictions: A numpy array of predicted classes or probabilities for the input images.
    """

    ## Load the pre-trained model architecture and weights
    with open(model_file_path + 'model_architecture.json', 'r') as json_file:
        loaded_model_json = json_file.read()
        loaded_model = tf.keras.models.model_from_json(loaded_model_json)

    ## Load the pre-trained model weights
    loaded_model.load_weights(model_file_path + 'model_weights.h5')

    ## Preprocess the image data (replace with actual preprocessing steps)
    preprocessed_image_data = preprocess_image_data(image_data)

    ## Perform classification on the preprocessed image data
    predictions = loaded_model.predict(preprocessed_image_data)

    return predictions
```

In this example:

- The function `perform_image_classification` takes `image_data` as input, which represents the medical image data to be classified.
- It loads the pre-trained deep learning model architecture and weights from the specified file path `models/trained_models/image_diagnosis_model/`.
- It preprocesses the input `image_data` (replace `preprocess_image_data` with actual image preprocessing steps) and then uses the pre-trained model to make predictions on the preprocessed images.
- The function returns the predictions, which could be the classes or probabilities predicted by the model.
