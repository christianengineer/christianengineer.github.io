### AI Drug Discovery using DeepChem

#### Objectives:
The objective of the AI Drug Discovery using DeepChem repository is to accelerate pharmaceutical development using machine learning and deep learning techniques. This involves building AI applications that can assist in the identification of potential drug candidates, scaffold hopping, property prediction, and other aspects of drug discovery.

#### System Design Strategies:
1. **Modular Design**: The system should be designed in a modular fashion to allow for easy integration of different machine learning models and algorithms.
2. **Scalability**: The system should be designed to scale with the increasing volume of molecular and chemical data.
3. **Flexibility**: The system should be flexible to accommodate different types of molecular and chemical data, as well as various machine learning models and algorithms.
4. **Performance**: The system should be designed for high performance to handle computationally intensive tasks such as molecular property prediction and ligand-based virtual screening.

#### Chosen Libraries:
1. **DeepChem**: DeepChem is a Python library for deep learning in drug discovery, chemoinformatics, and quantum chemistry. It provides a wide range of tools for working with molecular and chemical data, as well as a variety of pre-built machine learning models.
2. **TensorFlow or PyTorch**: TensorFlow or PyTorch can be used as the underlying deep learning framework for building and training neural networks for molecular property prediction, ligand-protein interaction modeling, and other drug discovery tasks.
3. **RDKit**: RDKit is an open-source cheminformatics software library that provides a wide range of tools for working with chemical structures, fingerprints, and molecular descriptors.

By leveraging these libraries and system design strategies, the AI Drug Discovery using DeepChem repository aims to provide a comprehensive framework for building scalable, data-intensive AI applications in pharmaceutical development.

### Infrastructure for Drug Discovery using DeepChem

The infrastructure for the Drug Discovery using DeepChem application needs to support the computational and data-intensive nature of the pharmaceutical development process. Below are the key components and considerations for the infrastructure:

#### Cloud-Based Architecture:
1. **Compute Resources**: Utilize cloud-based virtual machines or containers to provide scalable compute resources for running machine learning training, inference, and data processing tasks.
2. **Storage**: Leverage cloud storage solutions for storing large volumes of molecular and chemical data, as well as model checkpoints, datasets, and experiment results.
3. **Networking**: Ensure high-speed and reliable networking to facilitate data transfer between different components of the system.

#### Data Processing and Model Training:
1. **Data Pipelines**: Implement data pipelines for preprocessing and cleaning molecular and chemical data before feeding it into the machine learning models.
2. **Model Training**: Utilize distributed training frameworks to train machine learning models across multiple compute resources in parallel.

#### Model Serving and Inference:
1. **Model Deployment**: Deploy trained machine learning models as RESTful APIs or microservices for real-time inference and predictions.
2. **Auto-Scaling**: Implement auto-scaling mechanisms to dynamically adjust the number of inference servers based on the incoming workload.

#### Monitoring and Logging:
1. **Logging**: Implement centralized logging for monitoring system and application logs, as well as tracking model training and inference requests and responses.
2. **Metrics Collection**: Gather performance metrics such as model inference latency, resource utilization, and data processing throughput for performance monitoring and optimization.

#### Security and Compliance:
1. **Data Encryption**: Implement data encryption at rest and in transit to ensure the security and confidentiality of sensitive molecular and chemical data.
2. **Access Control**: Enforce fine-grained access controls to restrict access to critical systems and data to authorized personnel only.
3. **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations for handling pharmaceutical data and machine learning in healthcare.

By building the infrastructure around these components and considerations, the Drug Discovery using DeepChem application can effectively support the computational and data-intensive nature of pharmaceutical development while ensuring scalability, performance, and security.

```python
import deepchem as dc
import numpy as np
from deepchem.models import GraphConvModel
from deepchem.molnet import load_tox21

def run_complex_ml_algorithm(input_data_file_path):
    # Load the example dataset from DeepChem
    tox21_tasks, tox21_datasets, transformers = load_tox21(featurizer='GraphConv')
    train_dataset, valid_dataset, test_dataset = tox21_datasets

    # Create and train a graph convolution model
    model = GraphConvModel(
        len(tox21_tasks),
        mode='classification',
        dropout=0.2,
        batch_size=50,
        tensorboard=True
    )
    model.fit(train_dataset, nb_epoch=50)

    # Use the trained model to make predictions on mock data
    num_samples = 100
    num_features = 75
    mock_data = np.random.rand(num_samples, num_features)  # Replace with actual mock data from the input file path
    predictions = model.predict_on_batch(mock_data)
    
    return predictions
```

In this example, we define a `run_complex_ml_algorithm` function that implements a complex machine learning algorithm using the DeepChem library for drug discovery. The function takes a file path (`input_data_file_path`) as input, assuming the data is stored in a specific format. However, since we're using mock data, the mock_data variable is generated using random numbers.

The function loads a pre-processed dataset from the Tox21 dataset using DeepChem, creates a GraphConvModel for classification tasks, and trains the model using the training dataset. Finally, it uses the trained model to make predictions on the mock data and returns the predictions.

Please note that the actual input data loading and pre-processing steps may vary based on the specific format and requirements of the input data. Also, the `input_data_file_path` needs to point to the actual input data file containing the mock data for the algorithm.

```python
import deepchem as dc
import numpy as np
from deepchem.models import GraphConvModel

def run_complex_ml_algorithm(input_data_file_path):
    # Load and preprocess the input data
    # Assuming the input data is stored in a specific format and needs to be preprocessed
    # Example code to load and preprocess the input data from the file path
    input_data = load_and_preprocess_data(input_data_file_path)

    # Define the model architecture
    model = GraphConvModel(1, batch_size=100, mode='regression')

    # Split the input data into features (X) and target (y)
    X = input_data['features']
    y = input_data['target']

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X, y, nb_epoch=100)

    # Use the trained model to make predictions
    num_samples = 100
    mock_features = np.random.rand(num_samples, X.shape[1])  # Generating mock features for prediction
    predictions = model.predict_on_batch(mock_features)
    
    return predictions
```

In this example, we define a `run_complex_ml_algorithm` function for drug discovery using DeepChem. The function takes a file path (`input_data_file_path`) as input, assuming that the data is stored in a specific format. 

The function first loads and preprocesses the input data from the given file path, trains a GraphConvModel for regression using the preprocessed data, and then uses the trained model to make predictions on mock features. The mock features are generated using random numbers for demonstration purposes.

The actual `load_and_preprocess_data` function should handle the specific data loading and preprocessing steps required by the application. Additionally, the `input_data_file_path` variable should point to the actual input data file for the algorithm.
