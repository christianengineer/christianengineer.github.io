Certainly! Below is a mock implementation of a function for a complex machine learning algorithm using Prophet for demand forecasting in a supply chain setting. This function demonstrates how to utilize Prophet to train a demand forecasting model using mock data and save the trained model to a file. Additionally, it includes the file path for saving the trained model.

```python
import pandas as pd
from fbprophet import Prophet

def train_demand_forecasting_model(data_file_path, model_save_path):
    ## Load mock historical demand data from a CSV file
    historical_demand_data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Prepare the data in the required format by Prophet
    demand_data = historical_demand_data.rename(columns={'ds': 'ds', 'y': 'y'})

    ## Initialize and fit the Prophet model
    model = Prophet()
    model.fit(demand_data)

    ## Save the trained model to a file
    with open(model_save_path, 'wb') as f:
        pickle.dump(model, f)

    print("Demand forecasting model trained and saved successfully.")

## Mock file paths
data_file_path = "path_to_mock_demand_data.csv"
model_save_path = "path_to_save_trained_model.pkl"

## Call the function with the mock file paths
train_demand_forecasting_model(data_file_path, model_save_path)
```

In this example:

- The `train_demand_forecasting_model` function takes the file path to the mock demand data (`data_file_path`) and the file path to save the trained model (`model_save_path`) as input parameters.
- It loads the mock historical demand data from a CSV file, trains a Prophet model using the data, and saves the trained model to a file using Python's `pickle` module for serialization.
- Mock file paths are defined for the demand data and the location to save the trained model.

This function allows the application to train a demand forecasting model using Prophet with mock data and saving the trained model to a specified file path. In a real-world scenario, the function would utilize actual historical demand data and file paths specific to the application's environment.

Below is an example of a Python function that demonstrates the use of Prophet for demand forecasting in a supply chain setting using mock data. This function trains a Prophet forecasting model and saves the trained model to a file. The function also uses the mock file paths for the historical demand data and the path to save the trained model.

```python
import pandas as pd
from fbprophet import Prophet
import pickle

def train_and_save_demand_forecasting_model(data_file_path: str, model_save_path: str):
    ## Load mock historical demand data from a CSV file
    mock_demand_data = pd.DataFrame({
        'ds': pd.date_range(start='2022-01-01', periods=365, freq='D'),
        'y': [i + 10 for i in range(365)]  ## Mock demand values
    })

    ## Initialize and fit the Prophet model
    model = Prophet()
    model.fit(mock_demand_data)

    ## Save the trained model to a file
    with open(model_save_path, 'wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(model, file)

    print("Demand forecasting model trained and saved successfully.")

## Mock file paths
mock_data_file_path = "mock_demand_data.csv"
mock_model_save_path = "trained_demand_forecasting_model.pkl"

## Call the function with the mock file paths
train_and_save_demand_forecasting_model(mock_data_file_path, mock_model_save_path)
```

In this example:

- The `train_and_save_demand_forecasting_model` function takes two parameters: `data_file_path` for the mock demand data and `model_save_path` for the path to save the trained model.
- Mock demand data is generated using a pandas DataFrame with a date range and mock demand values for demonstration purposes.
- The function initializes a Prophet model, fits it with the mock demand data, and saves the trained model to a file using the `pickle` module.
- The mock file paths for the demand data and the trained model are defined.

The function allows for training a demand forecasting model using Prophet with mock data and saving the trained model to a specified file path. This function can be adapted to use real historical demand data and appropriate file paths in an actual deployment of the Supply Chain Demand Forecasting application.
