# IntelliCore: Central AI Operating Platform

## Description

IntelliCore is envisaged as the central hub for deploying, managing, and orchestrating AI-powered applications. This robust platform aims to streamline the development lifecycle of AI initiatives from conception to deployment, including continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), monitoring, scaling, and maintaining machine learning models in production environments.

Leveraging containerization and microservices architecture, IntelliCore is designed to be environment agnostic, capable of running on-premise or in any cloud environment. An intuitive interface, coupled with powerful API endpoints, ensures that developers and data scientists can focus on model development without worrying about infrastructure complexities.

## Objectives

1. **Scalability**: The ability to handle an increasing number of AI workloads efficiently across different computing environments.
2. **Modularity**: Structured to support a wide variety of AI models and data processing pipelines as interchangeable modules.
3. **Accessibility**: Providing user-friendly interfaces for both technical and non-technical users to interact with AI models.
4. **Collaboration**: Facilitate seamless collaboration among various stakeholders in AI projects, including developers, data scientists, and domain experts.
5. **Observability**: Offer real-time monitoring and logging capabilities for AI models to ensure performance and data accuracy.
6. **Security**: Implement industry-standard security practices to protect sensitive data throughout the model lifecycle.
7. **Compliance**: Ensure that the platform meets relevant regulatory and compliance requirements for different industries.

## Libraries Used

- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and deploying machine learning models.
- **PyTorch**: An alternative to TensorFlow, offering dynamic computation graphs for flexibility in model design.
- **Scikit-learn**: Employed for simpler machine learning algorithms and data processing tasks.
- **FastAPI**: For creating a high-performance, web-based API layer. It is utilized for its ease of use in creating model-serving endpoints.
- **Docker**: As the containerization solution, enabling the deployment of models and services in isolated environments.
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestrating containerized workloads and services, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: For monitoring the performance of the AI models and the health of the underlying infrastructure.
- **Fluentd/ElasticSearch/Kibana (EFK stack)**: To aggregate and visualize logs from various services and components.
- **Seldon Core**: For serving machine learning models at scale.
- **Apache Kafka**: For building real-time data pipelines and streaming apps.
- **Dask**: For parallel computing and extending the capabilities of Pandas and NumPy to larger datasets.

Additionally, IntelliCore would integrate with tools for version control (e.g., Git), ML experimentation & tracking (e.g., MLflow), feature store management, and data versioning to provide an end-to-end solution for AI application development and deployment.

### Notes:

- `/apps/` contains the different services. Each service should be self-contained with its own Dockerfile.
- `/common/` holds shared code that multiple services can use to prevent code duplication.
- `/data/` is a repository for datasets and ML models, although large files may need to be stored outside the git repository (using LFS or cloud storage).
- `/infra/` includes all infrastructure and deployment-related configurations.
- `/notebooks/` provides an area for exploratory data analysis and ML prototyping.
- `/tests/` organizes all the tests, which should cover different levels from units to integrations.
- `/web/` hosts the frontend application code for the IntelliCore platform's user interface.
- `/scripts/` is intended for various scripts used for deployment, environment setup, and other routine tasks.
- `/docs/` provides a home for documentation such as API specifications, architectural overviews, and getting started guides.

The use of `src` directories within each application or service module keeps the source code organized, especially if there are multiple languages or frameworks in use.

This file structure is meant to be flexible and should evolve as the platform grows and the needs of the team change. Regular refactoring may be necessary to ensure the structure supports the scalability and maintainability of the platform.

### Summary of IntelliCore Platform File Structure

The IntelliCore Platform repository is organized to support a scalable microservices architecture with a modular approach, ideal for extensive and evolving codebases.

#### Key Components:

- **`/apps/`**: Contains microservices such as the API gateway, user service, and AI engine, each with its own source code (`src`) and Dockerfile.

- **`/common/`**: Shared resources including database schemas (`database`), data models (`models`), and utilities (`utils`).

- **`/data/`**: Storage for datasets and machine learning models, possibly utilizing external storage for large files.

- **`/infra/`**: Infrastructure configurations using Kubernetes (`k8s`), Terraform, and Helm charts for deployment processes.

- **`/notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for research, data analysis, and ML experimentation.

- **`/tests/`**: Comprehensive testing suite divided into integration and unit tests for the platform services.

- **`/web/`**: Frontend codebase for the platform's dashboard with source files, build artifacts, and more.

- **`/scripts/`**: Utility and automation scripts for deployment and environment setup.

- **`/docs/`**: In-depth documentation including API references, architectural details, and beginner guides.

#### Organizational Approach:

- Microservices within `/apps/` are self-contained, promoting independence and scalability.

- Common code is centralized in `/common/` to avoid redundancy and facilitate code reuse.

- Data-related assets are consolidated in `/data/`, keeping them separate from codebases.

- Infrastructure and deployment are managed in `/infra/`, aligning with DevOps practices and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) philosophy.

- Research and prototyping are sequestered in `/notebooks/`, providing a sandbox for innovation.

- Testing is integral and structured within `/tests/`, ensuring reliability and quality.

- The web user interface is developed and maintained in `/web/`, segregating it from backend services.

- Routine and recurring tasks are scripted in `/scripts/`, improving efficiency and consistency.

- Documentation in `/docs/` serves as a knowledge base, ensuring everyone can quickly get up to speed.

This scalable structure is designed to be flexible, to accommodate growth, and to make the platform easy to maintain and refactor as necessary.

#### File Explanation:
The file `ai_engine_routes.py` is part of the IntelliCore Platform's API Gateway service. It defines FastAPI routes handling requests related to AI tasks. This file interfaces with the AI Engine, demonstrates request validation, error handling, and responses. Dependency injection is used for the AI Engine service interface, promoting testability and decoupling from specific AI Engine implementations. The models `AIRequestModel` and `AIResponseModel` aid in enforcing a schema for requests and responses, improving API usability and consistency. The two endpoints allow for processing of AI tasks and retrieval of AI model details, respectively.
