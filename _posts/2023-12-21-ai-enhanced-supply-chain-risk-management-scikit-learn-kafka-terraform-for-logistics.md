2. **Model Training and Pipelines**: Implement scalable and reproducible model training pipelines using frameworks like Kubeflow or Apache Airflow. These pipelines would orchestrate the end-to-end process of data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

3. **Model Registry**: Employ a model registry such as MLflow or a custom-built registry to store and manage trained model artifacts, along with metadata and performance metrics. This facilitates the tracking of model versions and allows for easy retrieval and deployment of models.

4. **Infrastructure Orchestration with Terraform**: Use Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, enabling the automated creation and management of scalable and resilient infrastructure resources, including cloud computing instances, storage, and networking components required for running the application and supporting machine learning workloads.

5. **Real-time Data Streaming and Processing with Kafka**: Integrate Kafka for real-time data streaming and processing, enabling the ingestion of live data from various sources, which can be used for real-time model inference, risk assessment, and decision-making within the logistics application.

6. **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging solutions, leveraging tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack, or cloud-native monitoring services to track the performance and health of both the application and the machine learning models in production.

7. **Deployment and Scaling**: Utilize containerization technologies like Docker and orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes for deploying and scaling the application components, including the machine learning models, in a consistent and scalable manner.

By integrating these components into the MLOps infrastructure, the AI-enhanced Supply Chain Risk Management application can achieve efficient model management, real-time data processing, and scalable deployment, underpinning its effectiveness in managing logistics-related risks through AI-driven insights.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a machine learning model using Scikit-Learn with mock data. The script uses a simple logistic regression model for risk prediction; however, in a real-world scenario, more sophisticated models and actual data would be used for training.

### File: train_model.py
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import joblib

# Load mock data (replace with actual data loading code)
data_path = 'data/mock_risk_data.csv'
mock_data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

# Preprocessing and feature engineering (replace with actual data preprocessing code)
X = mock_data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']]
y = mock_data['risk_label']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Model accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')

# Save the trained model to a file
model_output_path = 'models/trained_models/risk_prediction_model_v1.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, model_output_path)

# Additional metadata and versioning (create and save model metadata JSON file)
metadata = {
    'model_type': 'Logistic Regression',
    'features': ['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3'],
    'accuracy': accuracy,
    'version': 'v1'
}
metadata_output_path = 'models/model_registry/metadata/risk_prediction_model_v1_metadata.json'
with open(metadata_output_path, 'w') as metadata_file:
    json.dump(metadata, metadata_file)

print('Model training and metadata file creation completed.')
```

In this example:
- The script loads mock data from a CSV file, preprocesses the data, and splits it into training and testing sets.
- It then trains a logistic regression model using the training data and evaluates its performance on the test data.
- The trained model is saved as a pickle file in the specified model output path, and the metadata associated with the model is saved in a JSON file within the model registry directory.

The file path for this script is: `AI-enhanced-Supply-Chain-Risk-Management/src/model_training/train_model.py`

This script demonstrates the training of a machine learning model using Scikit-Learn and the creation of associated model artifacts and metadata within the project's file structure.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a complex machine learning algorithm (Random Forest Classifier) using Scikit-Learn with mock data. The script uses a more sophisticated model for risk prediction compared to the logistic regression model, and it is intended to showcase a more advanced machine learning approach.

### File: train_complex_model.py
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import joblib
import json

# Load mock data (replace with actual data loading code)
data_path = 'data/mock_risk_data.csv'
mock_data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

# Preprocessing and feature engineering (replace with actual data preprocessing code)
X = mock_data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']]
y = mock_data['risk_label']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the random forest classifier model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=5, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Model accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')

# Save the trained model to a file
model_output_path = 'models/trained_models/complex_model_v1.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, model_output_path)

# Additional metadata and versioning (create and save model metadata JSON file)
metadata = {
    'model_type': 'Random Forest Classifier',
    'features': ['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3'],
    'accuracy': accuracy,
    'parameters': {
        'n_estimators': 100,
        'max_depth': 5
    },
    'version': 'v1'
}
metadata_output_path = 'models/model_registry/metadata/complex_model_v1_metadata.json'
with open(metadata_output_path, 'w') as metadata_file:
    json.dump(metadata, metadata_file)

print('Complex model training and metadata file creation completed.')
```

In this example:
- The script loads mock data from a CSV file, preprocesses the data, and splits it into training and testing sets.
- It then trains a Random Forest Classifier using the training data and evaluates its performance on the test data.
- The trained model is saved as a pickle file in the specified model output path, and the metadata associated with the model is saved in a JSON file within the model registry directory.

The file path for this script is: `AI-enhanced-Supply-Chain-Risk-Management/src/model_training/train_complex_model.py`

This script demonstrates the training of a more complex machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) using Scikit-Learn with mock data, showcasing a more advanced machine learning approach within the project's file structure.
