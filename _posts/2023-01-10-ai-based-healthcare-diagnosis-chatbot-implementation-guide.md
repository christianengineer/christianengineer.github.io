# Healthcare Chatbot for Diagnosis Assistance

## Description

This repository is for the Healthcare Chatbot for Diagnosis Assistance project. This is an advanced healthcare solution aimed to streamline patient-doctor interaction by leveraging artificial intelligence. It's designed to provide users with immediate responses to health-related queries. The main purpose of this project is to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, especially in these tumultuous times when immediate healthcare assistance is paramount. Users can input their symptoms and the bot will suggest potential diagnoses based on the inputs.

## Goals

1. To provide immediate and personalized health diagnoses to users, thereby reducing the dependence on healthcare professionals for minor queries.
2. To create a scalable and user-friendly bot capable of handling thousands of user queries simultaneously.
3. To continuously improve the accuracy of diagnoses suggestions using machine learning algorithms.

## Libraries and Technologies

Here are the main libraries and technologies we plan to use for efficient data handling and scalable user traffic:

#### Front-end

1. **ReactJS**: We will use ReactJS for building the user interface. It is a JavaScript library for creating interactive UIs and is perfect for building single-page applications.
2. **Redux**: Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps us write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments, and are easy to test.

#### Back-end

1. **Node.js**: Node.js will be used for the back-end. It offers a highly scalable network programming environment that can handle lots of simultaneous connections with high throughput, which aligns with the goal of handling scalable user traffic.
2. **Express.js**: Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides robust features for web and mobile applications.

#### Database

1. **MongoDB**: MongoDB, a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program, will be used to store conversations and patient data.
2. **Mongoose**: As an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, Mongoose provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model your application data.

#### Natural Language Processing

1. **Dialogflow API**: For converting user queries into understandable data, we will be using Dialogflow. It enables us to understand the intent behind the user's text and respond accordingly.

#### Other Libraries

1. **Socket.io**: For real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server.
2. **JWT**: For securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object, it will be used for user authentication and session management.

This structure separates the front-end and back-end directories for clear distinction of responsibilities. It makes it easier to manage, test, and maintain the project as it scales, as each aspect of the project has its specific location in the directory structure.

# File: server/controllers/chatbotController.js

This file contains the main logic for the Healthcare Chatbot for Diagnosis Assistance. It is located in the server `controllers` directory.

Here's a basic example of what this might look like:

```javascript
const dialogflow = require('@google-cloud/dialogflow');
const uuid = require('uuid');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Sessions = mongoose.model('sessions');

const projectId = process.env.DIALOGFLOW_PROJECT_ID;

// Create a new session
const sessionClient = new dialogflow.SessionsClient();
const sessionId = uuid.v4();
const sessionPath = sessionClient.projectAgentSessionPath(projectId, sessionId);

const chatbotController = {};

// Function to process user message and return AI response
chatbotController.processMessage = async function(req, res) {
    const { message } = req.body;

    const request = {
        session: sessionPath,
        queryInput: {
            text: {
                text: message,
                languageCode: 'en-US',
            },
        },
    };

    let responses;
    try {
        responses = await sessionClient.detectIntent(request);
    } catch(err) {
        console.error('Dialogflow detectIntent error: ', err);
        return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Unexpected error processing message.' });
    }

    // If a response was received from Dialogflow, return that response to the user
    if (responses[0] && responses[0].queryResult && responses[0].queryResult.fulfillmentText) {
        return res.json({ response: responses[0].queryResult.fulfillmentText });
    }

    // If no response was received from Dialogflow, return a default message
    return res.json({ response: 'I did not understand that. Please try again.' });
};

module.exports = chatbotController;
````

This controller file exports a single function, `processMessage`, which processes a user's message input, sends it to Dialogflow for natural language understanding and intent detection, and then returns the Dialogflow agent's response to the user.

```

```
