Sure, here's an example of a function for a complex machine learning algorithm that utilizes mock data. For demonstration purposes, let's consider a hypothetical anomaly detection algorithm using Isolation Forest, a popular technique for detecting anomalies in data.

```python
# File: AI/anomaly_detection/anomaly_detection_model.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

def train_anomaly_detection_model(data_file_path):
    # Load the mock data from the specified file path
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Assume 'feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3' are the relevant features for anomaly detection
    X = data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']]

    # Normalize the data
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize and train the Isolation Forest model
    model = IsolationForest(n_estimators=100, contamination=0.05, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train)

    # Make predictions on the test data
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

    # Evaluate the model's performance
    print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
    print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))

    # Return the trained model for serving
    return model
```

In this example, we're assuming the existence of a CSV file at the provided file path containing mock data for training the anomaly detection model. The function `train_anomaly_detection_model` reads the mock data, preprocesses it by standardizing the features, trains an Isolation Forest model on the processed data, evaluates its performance, and finally returns the trained model for serving.

This function is located in the `anomaly_detection` sub-directory within the `AI` directory of the CyberShield - AI-Based Cybersecurity System application. The file path mentioned in the function corresponds to the location of the mock data file used for training the machine learning algorithm.

Here's an example of a function for a complex deep learning algorithm that utilizes mock data. For demonstration purposes, let's consider a hypothetical deep learning algorithm using TensorFlow for network intrusion detection, a common application in cybersecurity.

```python
# File: AI/intrusion_detection/intrusion_detection_model.py

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

def train_intrusion_detection_model(data_file_path):
    # Load the mock data from the specified file path
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Assume 'feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3' are the relevant features for intrusion detection
    X = data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']]
    y = data['target_variable']

    # Normalize the data
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Build the deep learning model using TensorFlow
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    # Evaluate the model's performance
    y_pred = (model.predict(X_test) > 0.5).astype("int32")
    print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
    print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))

    # Return the trained model for serving
    return model
```

In this example, the function `train_intrusion_detection_model` is located in the `intrusion_detection` sub-directory within the `AI` directory of the CyberShield - AI-Based Cybersecurity System application. The function reads the mock data from the provided file path, preprocesses it using standard scaling, builds a deep learning model using TensorFlow, trains the model, evaluates its performance, and returns the trained model for serving.

The file path mentioned in the function corresponds to the location of the mock data file used for training the deep learning algorithm.
