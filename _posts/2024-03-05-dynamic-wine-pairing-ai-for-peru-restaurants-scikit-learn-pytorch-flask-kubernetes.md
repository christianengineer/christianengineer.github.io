## Modeling Strategy for Dynamic Wine Pairing AI

Modeling plays a crucial role in the Dynamic Wine Pairing AI project, where machine learning algorithms are employed to analyze flavor profiles and suggest optimal wine pairings for menu items. Below is a detailed step-by-step modeling strategy, prioritizing the most important step for this project:

By structuring the modeling directory with specific subdirectories for data processing, model training, evaluation, ensembling, cross-validation, deployment, and storing trained models, the project maintains a systematic approach to building, evaluating, and deploying machine learning models for the Dynamic Wine Pairing AI. Each file and script in the directory performs essential functions in the modeling pipeline, contributing to the success of the project.

To generate a large fictitious mocked structured data file for training the model in the Dynamic Wine Pairing AI project, we can create a CSV file containing synthetic data relating to menu items, flavor profiles, and wine pairings. Below is an example of how the data file might be structured:

```plaintext
menu_item,flavor_profile_1,flavor_profile_2,flavor_profile_3,wine_type,wine_variant
Ceviche,1.2,0.8,0.5,White,WineA
Lomo Saltado,0.9,0.7,0.2,Red,WineB
Aji de Gallina,0.6,0.5,0.4,White,WineC
Tiradito,1.0,0.6,0.7,White,WineD
Anticuchos,0.8,0.9,0.3,Red,WineE
Causa,0.7,0.4,0.6,White,WineF
Seco de Cordero,0.9,1.0,0.8,Red,WineG
Papa a la Huancaina,0.5,0.3,0.7,White,WineH
Picarones,0.8,0.8,0.6,Red,WineI
Chupe de Camarones,1.0,0.9,0.4,White,WineJ
...
```

In this example data file:
- Each row represents a menu item with corresponding flavor profile attributes and suggested wine pairing.
- The `menu_item` column lists the name of the dish.
- The `flavor_profile_1`, `flavor_profile_2`, and `flavor_profile_3` columns represent numerical values indicating different flavor components.
- The `wine_type` column specifies the type of wine (e.g., White, Red).
- The `wine_variant` column suggests a specific wine variant for pairing with the menu item.

This synthetic data can be used to train machine learning models to predict wine pairings based on flavor profiles of menu items. The actual data for the project would be sourced from real sources and may include a more extensive list of dishes, flavor profiles, and wine pairings.

To train the model with the mocked data in a production-ready manner, we can create a Python script that loads the synthetic data from a CSV file, preprocesses it, trains the model, and saves the trained model for deployment. Below is the production-ready code for training the model with the mocked data:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import joblib

## Load synthetic data from CSV file
data_path = 'data/mock_data.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(data_path)

## Separate features and target variable
X = data[['flavor_profile_1', 'flavor_profile_2', 'flavor_profile_3']]
y = data['wine_variant']

## Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Train a Random Forest classifier
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier()
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Evaluate model
accuracy = rf_model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Model accuracy: {accuracy}')

## Save the trained model
model_output_path = 'models/mock_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(rf_model, model_output_path)
print(f'Trained model saved at: {model_output_path}')
```

In this code snippet:
- We load the synthetic mocked data stored in a CSV file located at `'data/mock_data.csv'`.
- The script separates the input features (flavor profiles) and the target variable (wine variant).
- The data is split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.
- We train a Random Forest classifier on the data.
- The model's accuracy is evaluated on the test set.
- Finally, the trained model is saved as a pickle file at `'models/mock_model.pkl'`.

This code demonstrates a simplified version of training a model with mocked data. In a real-world scenario, additional preprocessing steps, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation may be required for optimal model performance.

## Deployment Strategy for Dynamic Wine Pairing AI

Deploying the Dynamic Wine Pairing AI across different environments (local, development, staging, production) requires a systematic approach to ensure smooth transitions and consistent performance. Below is a step-by-step guide on deploying the AI solution in various environments:

### Local Environment:

1. **Development Server Setup**:

By following this step-by-step deployment strategy across local, development, staging, and production environments, the Dynamic Wine Pairing AI project can ensure a smooth transition from development to production while maintaining consistency and performance at each stage.

To create a production-ready Dockerfile for the Dynamic Wine Pairing AI project, we can containerize the Flask application along with its dependencies and configurations. Below is an example of a Dockerfile that sets up the environment for running the Flask application in a production-ready Docker container:

```Dockerfile
## Use a base Python image
FROM python:3.9-slim

## Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

## Copy the requirements file and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

## Copy the Flask application code into the container
COPY app.py /app/
COPY config.py /app/
COPY models/model.pkl /app/models/

## Expose a port for the Flask application
EXPOSE 5000

## Define the command to run the Flask application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

In this Dockerfile:
- We start by using the official Python 3.9-slim base image.
- The working directory in the container is set to `/app`.
- The `requirements.txt` file containing the necessary Python dependencies is copied and installed.
- The Flask application code (`app.py`), configuration file (`config.py`), and the trained model file (`model.pkl`) are copied into the container.
- We expose port 5000 for the Flask application to listen to incoming requests.
- The command to start the Flask application inside the container is defined using `CMD`.

To build the Docker image, you can run the following command in the terminal where the Dockerfile is located:

```bash
docker build -t dynamic-wine-pairing-ai .
```

Once the Docker image is built, you can run a container based on the image using:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 dynamic-wine-pairing-ai
```

This will start the Flask application inside the Docker container, and you can access it at `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.
