Below is an example of a function implementing a complex machine learning algorithm for the FraudGuard - AI Fraud Detection System application. In this example, we'll create a function for training a Gradient Boosting Classifier using mock data. The function will take mock input data, perform feature engineering, train the model, and serialize the trained model to a file.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import joblib

def train_gradient_boosting_model(data_file_path, model_output_path):
    # Load mock data from a CSV file
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Data preprocessing and feature engineering (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
    # Example:
    # X = data.drop('target_column', axis=1)
    # y = data['target_column']
    # X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Instantiate a Gradient Boosting Classifier model
    model = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=1.0, max_depth=1, random_state=42)

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Evaluate the model
    # Example:
    # accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
    # print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy}")

    # Serialize the trained model to a file
    joblib.dump(model, model_output_path)

    # Return the path to the serialized model
    return model_output_path
```

In this example:
- The `train_gradient_boosting_model` function takes the file path for the mock input data (`data_file_path`) and the desired output path for the serialized model (`model_output_path`).
- It loads the mock data from a CSV file, performs data preprocessing and feature engineering (note that this part of the code is commented out as it requires specific feature engineering based on the actual data).
- It instantiates a Gradient Boosting Classifier model and trains the model using the preprocessed data.
- After training, the model is serialized to a file using the `joblib.dump` function.
- The function returns the path to the serialized model file, which can then be used for model serving and inference within the FraudGuard system.

Please note that the data preprocessing and model evaluation sections are partially shown and would need to be adapted based on specific requirements and the actual characteristics of the data and model.

Certainly! Below is an example of a function implementing a complex deep learning algorithm for the FraudGuard - AI Fraud Detection System application. In this example, we'll create a function for training a deep learning model using a neural network with TensorFlow and Keras. The function will take mock input data, perform preprocessing, train the deep learning model, and save the trained model to a file.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def train_deep_learning_model(data_file_path, model_output_path):
    # Load mock data from a CSV file
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Data preprocessing and feature engineering (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
    # Example:
    # X = data.drop('target_column', axis=1)
    # y = data['target_column']
    # X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Define a deep learning neural network model using Keras
    model = keras.Sequential([
        keras.layers.Dense(128, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],), activation='relu'),
        keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

    # Compile the model
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

    # Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    # Evaluate the model
    # Example:
    # loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
    # print(f"Model loss: {loss}, Model accuracy: {accuracy}")

    # Save the trained model to a file
    model.save(model_output_path)

    # Return the path to the saved model file
    return model_output_path
```

In this example:
- The `train_deep_learning_model` function takes the file path for the mock input data (`data_file_path`) and the desired output path for the saved model (`model_output_path`).
- It loads the mock data from a CSV file, performs data preprocessing and feature engineering (note that this part of the code is commented out as it requires specific feature engineering based on the actual data).
- It defines a deep learning neural network model using the Keras API from TensorFlow.
- The model is compiled, trained using the training data, and evaluated using the testing data.
- After training, the model is saved to a file using the `model.save` method.
- The function returns the path to the saved model file, which can then be used for model serving and inference within the FraudGuard system.

Please note that the data preprocessing and model evaluation sections are partially shown and would need to be adapted based on specific requirements and the actual characteristics of the data and model.
