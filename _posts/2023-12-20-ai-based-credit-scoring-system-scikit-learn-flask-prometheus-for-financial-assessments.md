# AI-Based Credit Scoring System Repository

## Objectives
The objective of this repository is to build an AI-based Credit Scoring System that leverages Machine Learning to assess the creditworthiness of individuals or businesses. The system aims to provide accurate and scalable credit scoring by analyzing a variety of data points and generating predictive models to assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.

## System Design Strategies
To achieve the objectives, the following system design strategies can be employed:
1. **Scalability**: Design the system to handle large volumes of data and efficiently process credit scoring requests in real-time.
2. **Modularity**: Create a modular system that allows for easy integration of different machine learning models, data pipelines, and APIs.
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement monitoring and tracking mechanisms to measure the performance of the credit scoring models and overall system.
4. **Security**: Ensure that the system adheres to industry standards for data security and privacy, especially when dealing with sensitive financial information.

## Chosen Libraries and Frameworks
The system can be built using the following libraries and frameworks:
- **Scikit-Learn**: Utilize Scikit-Learn for training and deploying machine learning models for credit scoring. It provides a wide range of algorithms for classification and regression, which are essential for credit risk assessment.
- **Flask**: Use Flask as the web framework to build RESTful APIs for credit scoring requests. Flask provides a lightweight and scalable infrastructure for serving machine learning models as microservices.
- **Prometheus**: Integrate Prometheus for monitoring the performance and health of the AI-based credit scoring system. Prometheus can be used to collect and visualize key metrics, such as model accuracy, response times, and resource utilization.

By leveraging these libraries and frameworks, the AI-based Credit Scoring System can be developed with a strong foundation in machine learning, web services, and system monitoring, ensuring its effectiveness, scalability, and maintainability.

# MLOps Infrastructure for AI-Based Credit Scoring System

To build a robust MLOps infrastructure for the AI-based Credit Scoring System, we will incorporate modern practices and tools that enable seamless integration, deployment, monitoring, and management of machine learning models. The infrastructure will focus on automating the end-to-end ML lifecycle, ensuring reproducibility, and maintaining model quality and consistency.

## Components and Strategies

### Version Control
1. **Git**: Utilize Git for version control to track changes in code, model configurations, and data preprocessing scripts. This ensures traceability and reproducibility of model training.

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
2. **Jenkins/Travis CI**: Implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, testing, and deployment of the AI-based Credit Scoring System. This includes running unit tests, model validation, and deploying new model versions when changes are made.

### Model Training and Serving
3. **Scikit-Learn**: Use Scikit-Learn for building and training machine learning models for credit scoring. The trained models can be serialized and stored in a model registry.
4. **Docker**: Containerize the Flask-based credit scoring API using Docker, enabling seamless deployment and scalability.
5. **Kubernetes**: Deploy the Docker containers in a Kubernetes cluster to manage and scale the API endpoints efficiently.

### Monitoring and Logging
6. **Prometheus/Grafana**: Integrate Prometheus for collecting metrics from the deployed API endpoints, monitoring model performance, and tracking system health. Grafana can be used to visualize and create dashboards for monitoring purposes.
7. **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: Implement centralized logging using the ELK stack to capture and analyze logs generated by the AI-based Credit Scoring System components.

### Model Governance and Management
8. **Model Registry**: Utilize a model registry or artifact repository (e.g., MLflow, DVC) to manage model versions, track experiment results, and store artifacts such as trained models, hyperparameters, and performance metrics.
9. **Model Validation**: Implement automated model validation checks to ensure that newly trained models meet predefined performance and quality thresholds before deployment.

### Security and Compliance
10. **Secrets Management**: Use a secure secrets management tool, such as HashiCorp Vault, to manage API keys, credentials, and other sensitive information.
11. **Compliance and Governance**: Implement access control, audit trails, and compliance monitoring to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements and data privacy standards (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

By integrating these components and strategies into the MLOps infrastructure, the AI-based Credit Scoring System can achieve automation, scalability, and reliability, enabling efficient management of machine learning models and ensuring the system's effectiveness in financial assessments.

# ml_model/model_training/train_model.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
import joblib

# Load mock data
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_mock_data/mock_credit_data.csv')

# Preprocessing and feature engineering (not shown in this example)
# ...

# Split the data into features and target variable
X = data.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
y = data['target_variable']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the Random Forest classifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')

# Generate classification report
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
print(report)

# Serialize the trained model
joblib.dump(model, 'path_to_save_model/trained_credit_scoring_model.pkl')
```

In this example, the `train_model.py` file demonstrates the training of a RandomForestClassifier model using mock credit data. The script performs data loading, preprocessing, splitting into training and testing sets, model training, evaluation, and serialization of the trained model using joblib.

The file path for the mock data and the location to save the trained model should be appropriately specified in the script. Additionally, preprocessing and feature engineering steps would typically be included in the actual implementation to prepare the data for model training.

```python
# ml_model/model_training/train_model.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
import joblib

# Load mock data
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_mock_data/mock_credit_data.csv')

# Preprocessing and feature engineering (not shown in this example)
# ...

# Split the data into features and target variable
X = data.drop('target_variable', axis=1)
y = data['target_variable']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the Gradient Boosting classifier
model = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)
print(report)

# Serialize the trained model
joblib.dump(model, 'path_to_save_model/trained_credit_scoring_model.pkl')
```

In this example, the `train_model.py` file demonstrates the training of a Gradient Boosting Classifier model using mock credit data. The script performs data loading, preprocessing, splitting into training and testing sets, model training, evaluation, and serialization of the trained model using joblib.

The file path for the mock data and the location to save the trained model should be appropriately specified in the script. Additionally, the preprocessing and feature engineering steps would be included in the actual implementation to prepare the data for model training.
