# Machine Learning Enhanced Photo Editor

## Description

The Machine Learning Enhanced Photo Editor is a project aimed at developing a robust web-based photo editing tool that utilizes advanced machine learning technologies. With the ability to learn from repeated user interactions and patterns, and consequently improve user-experience, this tool is set to revolutionize photo-editing workflows.

This application will incorporate a wide range of traditional photo-editing features, such as cropping, filter application, exposure adjustment, as well as more contemporary methods such as object removal, facial recognition, and style transfer. All of these features will be supported by an intelligent, machine-learning backend designed to understand the user's preferences and improve over time based on user feedback and interaction. The goal is to provide a high-quality, personalized user experience that simplifies complex photo-editing tasks using machine learning.

## Goals

1. **Intelligent User Interface**: Develop a user interface that can learn and adapt to the user preferences and workflow with continued use.

2. **Diverse Feature Set**: Integrate traditional photo editing tools into the web-based application.

3. **Machine Learning Models**: Develop and implement machine learning models capable of object recognition, image segmentation, and style transfer.

4. **Scalability**: Design a well-structured backend that handles data efficiently and can deal with high user traffic, ensuring seamless user experience.

5. **Continuous Learning and Improvement**: Implement a loop for continuous learning based on user feedback and actions performed on the editor.

6. **User-History Log**: Maintain a user action history log for better user-specific suggestions and faster photo editing.

## Libraries and Tools

The application will be built using a combination of powerful libraries and tools for both the frontend, backend, and machine learning aspects. Below are some of the technologies planned for use:

1. **TensorFlow**: This open-source, machine learning framework will be used to train and implement the various machine-learning models used in the project.

2. **ReactJS**: For the development of the user interface. It will provide a fast, reliable, and interactive interface to the users.

3. **Node.js and Express.js**: These tools will be used for building an efficient and scalable server-side. They will power the API, handle user requests, and control data flow within the application.

4. **MongoDB**: This NoSQL database will manage the user data efficiently, enabling scaling with high traffic.

5. **Redux**: This state container for JavaScript applications simplifies state management and makes it easier to trace the changes in the application.

6. **Heroku or AWS**: For deployment and serving the application with a good uptime.

7. **Docker**: Will enable the application to run seamlessly in any environment.

# File: ml_controller.py

## Folder Location:

`/server/controllers/ml_controller.py`

This is a placeholder file for the controller in the backend handling all the machine-learning related operations such as model training, applying editing features on images using these models, etc.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# Add path for custom models or utilities if any
# import custom_models
# import utils

class MLController:

    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize your ML models here
        self.model = None
        # self.model = custom_models.CustomModel()

    # Modifying an image using a pre-trained ML model
    def apply_feature(self, image, feature):
        """
        This method applies the ML-driven feature on the given image
        :param image: image file to apply the feature
        :param feature: features to be applied - style_transfer, object_remove, etc.
        :return: modified image
        """
        # Implement feature application logic here using self.model
        modified_img = image
        return modified_img

    # Add more functions as needed for handling ML operations
    # def train_model(self, train_data):
    #   ...

    # def evaluate_model(self, test_data):
    #   ...

```

The `MLController` class houses all the methods that undertake operations fueled by machine learning, such as applying a particular editing feature on an image. We initialize our machine learning models in the constructor. Models can be custom-made or pre-trained models depending on the project's requirements.

Please note, this is a placeholder with an example structure. Adhere to best practices to manage your models effeciently, keeping mind the scope of your application and performance requirements.
