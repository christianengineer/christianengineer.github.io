from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

def complex_machine_learning_algorithm(data_file_path):
    # Load the mock environmental data from the specified file path
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    # Assume the target variable is 'environmental_quality' and the features are other columns
    X = data.drop('environmental_quality', axis=1)
    y = data['environmental_quality']

    # Split the data into training and testing sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Initialize and train a Random Forest Regressor model
    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Make predictions on the testing set

- It then makes predictions on the testing set and evaluates the model's performance using Mean Squared Error.

This function showcases a typical workflow for building and evaluating a machine learning model. The returned values include the trained model and the Mean Squared Error as a measure of model performance.
