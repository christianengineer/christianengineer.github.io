def clean_data(df):
    # Drop any rows with missing data
    df.dropna(inplace=True)
    
    # Normalize numerical data
    min_max_scaler = preprocessing.MinMaxScaler()
    df[['transaction_timestamp']] = min_max_scaler.fit_transform(df[['transaction_timestamp']])
    
    # Text data preprocessing
    df['supplier_details'] = df['supplier_details'].apply(lambda x: ' '.join([word for word in x.split() if word.isalpha()]))
