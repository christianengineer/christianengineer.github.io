Certainly! Below is a sample Python script for training a GPT model using mock data for the Public Library Digital Access Tools application. The file is named `train_gpt_model.py`, and it is located in the `ml/models/gpt/` directory within the project's directory structure.

```python
## ml/models/gpt/train_gpt_model.py

import torch
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer
import os
import json
import random

## Define the paths for data and model
data_path = "/path/to/mock/data.json"
model_directory = "/path/to/save/model/"

## Load and preprocess mock data
with open(data_path, "r") as data_file:
    mock_data = json.load(data_file)

## Preprocessing and formatting of mock data
## Insert data preprocessing and formatting code here
## Example: tokenization, padding, and conversion to input tensor

## Training the GPT model on the mock data
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')

## Configure training settings
training_data = mock_data  ## Use the processed mock data
## Define the training process, optimizer, and loss function
## Example: Training loop using the mock data and model

## Save the trained model
if not os.path.exists(model_directory):
    os.makedirs(model_directory)

model_path = os.path.join(model_directory, "gpt_mock_trained_model")
model.save_pretrained(model_path)

print("Training of GPT model using mock data completed.")
```

In this script:

- The `data_path` variable specifies the path to the mock data file, which contains the sample data for training the GPT model.
- The script loads and preprocesses the mock data as needed for training the GPT model.
- The GPT model is initialized and trained on the mock data, followed by saving the trained model to the specified `model_directory`.

This script showcases a simplified example of training a GPT model using mock data. The paths and data processing steps would need to be adapted based on the actual data and training requirements for the Public Library Digital Access Tools application.

Given the complexity and scope of a machine learning algorithm, the implementation and training process can be extensive. Below is a simplified Python script for training a complex machine learning algorithm utilizing TensorFlow with mock data. The file is named `train_complex_ml_model.py`, and it is located in the `ml/models/tensorflow/` directory within the project's directory structure.

```python
## ml/models/tensorflow/train_complex_ml_model.py

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import numpy as np
import os
import json
import random

## Define the paths for data and model
data_path = "/path/to/mock/data.json"
model_directory = "/path/to/save/model/"

## Load and preprocess mock data
with open(data_path, "r") as data_file:
    mock_data = json.load(data_file)

## Perform complex data preprocessing and feature engineering
## Example: Feature engineering, data normalization, handling categorical features, etc.

## Split the mock data into features and labels
## Example: Prepare input features and target labels based on the mock data

## Build a complex machine learning model using TensorFlow
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_shape,)),
    layers.Dropout(0.2),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.2),
    layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

## Compile the model with optimizer, loss function, and metrics
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model using the mock data
model.fit(train_features, train_labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(val_features, val_labels))

## Evaluate the model on the mock validation data
validation_loss, validation_accuracy = model.evaluate(val_features, val_labels)

## Save the trained complex machine learning model
if not os.path.exists(model_directory):
    os.makedirs(model_directory)

model.save(os.path.join(model_directory, "complex_ml_model"))

print("Training of complex machine learning model using mock data completed.")
```

In this script:

- The `data_path` variable specifies the path to the mock data file, which contains the sample data for training the complex machine learning model.
- The script loads and preprocesses the mock data to prepare it for training the model.
- A complex machine learning model is built using TensorFlow, including data preprocessing, model construction, compilation, training, and evaluation.
- The trained complex machine learning model is saved to the specified `model_directory`.

This script demonstrates a simplified example of training a complex machine learning model using TensorFlow with mock data. The paths, data processing steps, and model architecture would need to be tailored based on the application's requirements and the complexity of the machine learning algorithm.
