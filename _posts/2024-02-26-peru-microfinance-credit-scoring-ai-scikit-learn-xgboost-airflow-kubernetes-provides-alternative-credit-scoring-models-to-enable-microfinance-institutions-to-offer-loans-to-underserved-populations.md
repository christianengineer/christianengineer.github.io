### Script for Training a Model using Mock Data:

#### File Path: `scripts/train_model_mock_data.py`

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Generate mock data (replace with actual data loading in production)
data = {
    'age': np.random.randint(21, 65, 1000),
    'income': np.random.randint(20000, 100000, 1000),
    'loan_amount': np.random.randint(1000, 5000, 1000),
    'credit_score': np.random.randint(300, 850, 1000),
    'approved_loan': np.random.choice([0, 1], 1000)
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Define features and target variable
X = df[['age', 'income', 'loan_amount', 'credit_score']]
y = df['approved_loan']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a RandomForestClassifier model
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier()
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

This script generates mock data, trains a RandomForestClassifier model using Scikit-Learn, and evaluates the model's performance by calculating the accuracy using the mock data. In a production setting, the mock data generation part should be replaced with actual data loading from the data source. This script can be run locally to train and evaluate the model for the Peru Microfinance Credit Scoring AI application.

### Script for Complex Machine Learning Algorithm using XGBoost and Mock Data:

#### File Path: `scripts/train_complex_model_mock_data.py`

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Generate mock data (replace with actual data loading in production)
data = {
    'age': np.random.randint(21, 65, 1000),
    'income': np.random.randint(20000, 100000, 1000),
    'loan_amount': np.random.randint(1000, 5000, 1000),
    'credit_score': np.random.randint(300, 850, 1000),
    'approved_loan': np.random.choice([0, 1], 1000)
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Define features and target variable
X = df[['age', 'income', 'loan_amount', 'credit_score']]
y = df['approved_loan']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train an XGBoost classifier model
xgb_model = xgb.XGBClassifier()
xgb_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = xgb_model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"XGBoost Model Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

This script generates mock data, trains a complex XGBoost classifier model, and evaluates the model's performance by calculating the accuracy using the mock data. In a production setting, the mock data generation part should be replaced with actual data loading from the data source. This script demonstrates the implementation of a more advanced machine learning algorithm using XGBoost for the Peru Microfinance Credit Scoring AI application.
