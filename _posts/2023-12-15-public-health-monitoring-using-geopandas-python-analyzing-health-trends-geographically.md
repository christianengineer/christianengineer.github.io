# AI Public Health Monitoring using Geopandas

## Objectives
The primary objective of the AI Public Health Monitoring using Geopandas project is to analyze and visualize health trends geographically. This involves the processing and analysis of large-scale health data to understand the distribution of diseases, healthcare resource allocation, and the identification of potential health hazards within specific geographic regions. The project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to predict and monitor public health trends, providing valuable insights for public health officials and policymakers.

## System Design Strategies
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: The system will gather health-related data from various sources such as public health agencies, research institutions, and community health centers. This data will be preprocessed to ensure consistency and accuracy before being utilized for analysis.
2. **Geospatial Analysis**: Geopandas will be leveraged for geospatial data manipulation and analysis. This involves the visualization of geographical data, overlaying health-related information on maps, and conducting spatial queries to identify patterns and trends.
3. **Machine Learning Integration**: Machine learning models will be developed and integrated into the system to predict and monitor public health trends. These models will utilize geospatial and health-related data to make accurate predictions and identify potential areas of concern.
4. **Scalability and Performance**: The system will be designed to handle large-scale, data-intensive operations. Utilizing scalable storage and processing solutions will ensure efficient handling of massive volumes of health and geographic data.

## Chosen Libraries
1. **Geopandas**: Geopandas is a fundamental library for working with geospatial data in Python. It provides high-level abstractions for manipulating and analyzing geospatial datasets, making it an excellent choice for this project's geospatial analysis requirements.
2. **Pandas**: Pandas will be used for data manipulation and preprocessing tasks. It integrates seamlessly with Geopandas and provides powerful tools for handling tabular data, which is essential for preparing the health-related datasets for analysis.
3. **Scikit-learn**: Scikit-learn will be utilized for developing and integrating machine learning models into the system. It offers a wide range of machine learning algorithms and tools for model evaluation, making it a suitable choice for implementing the predictive and monitoring aspects of the project.
4. **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: These visualization libraries will be used to create informative and visually appealing plots and maps to communicate the geospatial health trends and predictions effectively.

By following these design strategies and leveraging the chosen libraries, the AI Public Health Monitoring using Geopandas project aims to deliver a scalable, data-intensive, AI application that provides valuable insights into public health trends at a geographic level.

Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a machine learning model for the Public Health Monitoring using Geopandas application using mock data:

```python
# File Path: src/model_training.py

# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import joblib

# Mock health and geospatial data
health_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'region': ['Region A', 'Region B', 'Region A', 'Region C'],
    'population_density': [1000, 1500, 800, 1200],
    'average_income': [50000, 60000, 48000, 55000],
    'disease_prevalence': [0.05, 0.03, 0.06, 0.04]
})

geospatial_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'region': ['Region A', 'Region B', 'Region C'],
    'latitude': [40.7128, 34.0522, 41.8781],
    'longitude': [-74.0060, -118.2437, -87.6298]
})

# Merging health and geospatial data
merged_data = pd.merge(health_data, geospatial_data, on='region')

# Splitting the data into features and target
X = merged_data[['population_density', 'average_income', 'latitude', 'longitude']]
y = merged_data['disease_prevalence']

# Splitting the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Training a logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluating the model
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy}")

# Saving the trained model
model_file_path = 'models/trained_models/health_trend_prediction_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, model_file_path)
print(f"Trained model saved at {model_file_path}")
```

In this example, the Python script `model_training.py` uses mock health and geospatial data to train a logistic regression model for predicting disease prevalence based on geographic and health-related features. After training, the script saves the trained model to the specified file path `models/trained_models/health_trend_prediction_model.pkl`.

This script demonstrates the process of training a model using mock data and saving the trained model for later use within the Public Health Monitoring using Geopandas application.


Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script for training a complex machine learning algorithm, such as a Random Forest, for the Public Health Monitoring using Geopandas application using mock data:

```python
# File Path: src/model_training.py

# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import joblib

# Mock health and geospatial data
health_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'region': ['Region A', 'Region B', 'Region A', 'Region C'],
    'population_density': [1000, 1500, 800, 1200],
    'average_income': [50000, 60000, 48000, 55000],
    'disease_prevalence': [0, 1, 0, 1]  # Binary classification for demonstration
})

geospatial_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'region': ['Region A', 'Region B', 'Region C'],
    'latitude': [40.7128, 34.0522, 41.8781],
    'longitude': [-74.0060, -118.2437, -87.6298]
})

# Merging health and geospatial data
merged_data = pd.merge(health_data, geospatial_data, on='region')

# Splitting the data into features and target
X = merged_data[['population_density', 'average_income', 'latitude', 'longitude']]
y = merged_data['disease_prevalence']

# Splitting the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Training a Random Forest classifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=3, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluating the model
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy}")

# Saving the trained model
model_file_path = 'models/trained_models/health_trend_prediction_random_forest_model.pkl'
joblib.dump(model, model_file_path)
print(f"Trained model saved at {model_file_path}")
```

In this example, the Python script `model_training.py` uses mock health and geospatial data to train a Random Forest classifier for predicting disease prevalence based on geographic and health-related features. After training, the script saves the trained model to the specified file path `models/trained_models/health_trend_prediction_random_forest_model.pkl`.

This script demonstrates the training of a complex machine learning algorithm and the serialization of the trained model for later use within the Public Health Monitoring using Geopandas application.
