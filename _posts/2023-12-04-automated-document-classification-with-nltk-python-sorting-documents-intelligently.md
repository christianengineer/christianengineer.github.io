## Objectives

The objective of the AI Automated Document Classification system is to intelligently sort and categorize documents using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning algorithms. The system aims to automate the process of classifying documents into predefined categories based on their content.

## System Design Strategies

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The system will preprocess the documents using techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal to prepare the text data for analysis.
2. **Feature Extraction:** The system will extract relevant features from the preprocessed text data, such as word frequencies, n-grams, and TF-IDF scores, to represent the documents in a numerical form suitable for machine learning.
3. **Machine Learning Models:** The system will train machine learning models, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or Neural Networks, on the extracted features to learn the patterns and relationships between the documents and their respective categories.
4. **Model Evaluation and Selection:** The system will evaluate the performance of different machine learning models and select the most suitable one based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
5. **Deployment:** The system will provide a scalable and efficient way to deploy the trained model for real-time document classification, allowing users to submit new documents for automatic categorization.

## Chosen Libraries

1. **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** NLTK provides essential tools for NLP tasks like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stopwords removal. It also offers resources like corpora and lexicons for text analysis.
2. **Scikit-learn (sklearn):** Scikit-learn is a versatile machine learning library that provides implementations of various classification algorithms, feature extraction techniques, and model evaluation tools.
3. **TensorFlow or PyTorch:** For more advanced and deep learning-based approaches, we can leverage TensorFlow or PyTorch for building neural network models for document classification.
4. **Flask or FastAPI:** For model deployment, Flask or FastAPI can be used to create a RESTful API for serving the trained model and performing real-time document classification.

By utilizing these libraries and design strategies, we can build a scalable, data-intensive AI application for automated document classification that leverages the power of machine learning and NLP.

Certainly! Below is a Python function representing a complex machine learning algorithm for document classification using mock data. This function uses scikit-learn for model training and classification. The function takes mock text data, preprocesses it using NLTK, vectorizes it using TF-IDF, and trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for document classification. Once the model is trained, it classifies a new mock document.

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.svm import SVC
import numpy as np

def train_and_classify_document():
    ## Mock data
    documents = ["This is a mock document about technology.",
                 "The environment is a critical issue for sustainability.",
                 "I love reading books and exploring new cultures."]
    categories = ["technology", "environment", "culture"]

    new_document = "I am interested in learning about sustainable technologies."

    ## Preprocessing using NLTK
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    stemmer = PorterStemmer()
    processed_documents = []
    for document in documents:
        words = word_tokenize(document)
        filtered = [stemmer.stem(w.lower()) for w in words if w.isalpha() and w.lower() not in stop_words]
        processed_documents.append(' '.join(filtered))

    ## Feature extraction using TF-IDF
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    X = vectorizer.fit_transform(processed_documents)

    ## Training a Support Vector Machine classifier
    clf = SVC(kernel='linear')
    clf.fit(X, categories)

    ## Classifying a new document
    new_document = vectorizer.transform([new_document])
    predicted_category = clf.predict(new_document)

    return predicted_category[0]

## Call the function
predicted_category = train_and_classify_document()
print(predicted_category)
