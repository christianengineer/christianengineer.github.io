Sure, I can provide a sample Python file for training a PyTorch model for the AI-driven Energy Usage Forecasting for Buildings application using mock data. 

```python
# models/src/model_training.py

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load mock data for training
data = {
    'timestamp': pd.date_range(start='2022-01-01', end='2022-12-31', freq='H'),
    'temperature': np.random.uniform(18, 30, 8760),
    'humidity': np.random.uniform(40, 70, 8760),
    'occupancy': np.random.choice([0, 1], size=8760),
    'energy_usage': np.random.uniform(100, 500, 8760)
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
X = df[['timestamp', 'temperature', 'humidity', 'occupancy']]
y = df['energy_usage']

# Preprocessing and feature engineering (e.g., converting timestamp to numerical features, scaling, etc.)
# ...

# Split the data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define the PyTorch model
class EnergyUsagePredictor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(EnergyUsagePredictor, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        out = self.fc1(x)
        out = self.relu(out)
        out = self.fc2(out)
        return out

# Set hyperparameters and initialize the model
input_size = 3  # Assuming 3 input features (temperature, humidity, occupancy)
hidden_size = 32
output_size = 1  # Single output (energy usage)
learning_rate = 0.001
num_epochs = 100

model = EnergyUsagePredictor(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    inputs = torch.tensor(X_train.values, dtype=torch.float32)
    labels = torch.tensor(y_train.values, dtype=torch.float32)

    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    if (epoch+1) % 10 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')

# Save the trained model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'trained/model.pt')
```

In this file, `models/src/model_training.py`, we use mock data for training the PyTorch model. The mock data includes features such as temperature, humidity, occupancy, and energy usage. We preprocess the data, split it into training and validation sets, define a simple neural network model, and train the model using the defined hyperparameters and optimizer.

The trained model's state dictionary is then saved to the `trained/` directory within the `models` directory.

This file can be executed to train the model and save it as `trained/model.pt` in the project structure.

Please note that this is a simplified example using mock data and a basic neural network model. In a real-world scenario, the data preprocessing, model architecture, and training process would be more complex and comprehensive.

Certainly! Below is a sample Python script for a complex machine learning algorithm using a recurrent neural network (RNN) for the AI-driven Energy Usage Forecasting for Buildings application with mock data. The script is intended to showcase a more advanced model architecture capable of capturing temporal dependencies within the data.

```python
# models/src/model_training_complex.py

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load mock data for training
data = {
    'timestamp': pd.date_range(start='2022-01-01', end='2022-12-31', freq='H'),
    'temperature': np.random.uniform(18, 30, 8760),
    'humidity': np.random.uniform(40, 70, 8760),
    'occupancy': np.random.choice([0, 1], size=8760),
    'energy_usage': np.random.uniform(100, 500, 8760)
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
# Assuming the data is preprocessed and feature engineered to prepare it for the model

# Define the RNN model
class EnergyUsageRNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size, num_layers=2):
        super(EnergyUsageRNN, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.num_layers = num_layers
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        h0 = torch.zeros(self.num_layers, x.size(0), self.hidden_size).to(x.device)
        c0 = torch.zeros(self.num_layers, x.size(0), self.hidden_size).to(x.device)

        out, _ = self.lstm(x, (h0, c0))
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :])
        return out

# Set hyperparameters and initialize the model
input_size = 3  # Assuming 3 input features (temperature, humidity, occupancy)
hidden_size = 64
output_size = 1  # Single output (energy usage)
learning_rate = 0.001
num_epochs = 100

model = EnergyUsageRNN(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

# Prepare the data
X = df[['temperature', 'humidity', 'occupancy']].values
y = df['energy_usage'].values.reshape(-1, 1)

# Split the data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Data standardization, scaling, and transformation
# ...

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    inputs = torch.tensor(X_train, dtype=torch.float32).view(-1, 1, input_size)
    labels = torch.tensor(y_train, dtype=torch.float32)

    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    if (epoch+1) % 10 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')

# Save the trained model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'trained/complex_model.pt')
```

In this script, we use a more advanced RNN-based model to capture temporal patterns in the data. The model is trained using the mock data and the trained model's state dictionary is saved to the `trained/` directory within the `models` directory. This complex model is designed to showcase the use of advanced deep learning architectures for energy usage forecasting.

Please note that in a real-world scenario, the data preprocessing, model architecture, and training process would need to be more comprehensive and may require additional considerations for hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and model evaluation.
