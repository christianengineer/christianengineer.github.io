- **Data and Model Copy:** Copies the trained model file (marketing_roi_model.pkl) and preprocessed dataset (preprocessed_dataset.csv) to the container for inference.
- **Port Exposition:** Exposes port 5000 for API interaction with the deployed model.
- **API Command:** Defines the command to start the Flask API using app.py (replace with the actual script file).

This Dockerfile provides a structure for containerizing and deploying the machine learning model in a production environment for the Digital Marketing ROI Optimizer project, ensuring optimized performance and scalability to meet the project's specific objectives.
