It looks like the request is for the deployment directory in the Dynamic Energy Demand Prediction application using TensorFlow, Apache Beam, and Grafana. However, in the previous file structure and context, the deployment-related files were placed at the root level or in the Kubernetes directory for container deployment configurations.

To expand on the deployment-related files for the Dynamic Energy Demand Prediction application:

```python
## File Path: dynamic_energy_demand_prediction/models/tensorflow/train/train_model.py

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

## Mock Data (Replace with actual data loading code)
## Mock features and target labels for training
features = np.random.rand(100, 10)  ## Mock features (100 samples, 10 features)
labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(100, 1))  ## Mock binary labels (0 or 1)

## Define a simple neural network model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(10, input_shape=(10,), activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
model.fit(features, labels, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

## Save the trained model
model.save('dynamic_energy_demand_prediction/models/tensorflow/export/trained_model')
```

The above Python script (train_model.py) trains a simple neural network model using mock data for the Dynamic Energy Demand Prediction application. The script uses TensorFlow to define, compile, and train the model with the mock features and target labels. After training, the script saves the trained model in the specified directory ('dynamic_energy_demand_prediction/models/tensorflow/export/trained_model').

Note: In a real-world scenario, the mock data loading and model training logic would be replaced with actual data loading from sources such as Apache Beam pipelines, real-time data streams, or batch data processing. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning, validation, and evaluation steps are typically included in a comprehensive model training script for real applications.

```python
## File Path: dynamic_energy_demand_prediction/models/tensorflow/train/train_complex_model.py

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

## Mock Data (Replace with actual data loading code)
## Mock features and target labels for training
features = np.random.rand(1000, 20)  ## Mock features (1000 samples, 20 features)
labels = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(1000, 1))  ## Mock binary labels (0 or 1)

## Data preprocessing
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_features = scaler.fit_transform(features)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(scaled_features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Define a complex neural network model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, input_shape=(20,), activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dropout(0.5),
    keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

## Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

## Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=(X_test, y_test), epochs=20, batch_size=64)

## Save the trained model
model.save('dynamic_energy_demand_prediction/models/tensorflow/export/complex_trained_model')
```

The above Python script (train_complex_model.py) trains a complex neural network model using mock data for the Dynamic Energy Demand Prediction application. The script uses TensorFlow to define, compile, and train the model with the mock features and target labels. The data preprocessing step includes feature scaling and train-test split using `StandardScaler` and `train_test_split` from the `sklearn` library. After training, the script saves the trained model in the specified directory ('dynamic_energy_demand_prediction/models/tensorflow/export/complex_trained_model').

Note: In a real-world scenario, the mock data loading and model training logic would be replaced with actual data loading from utilities data sources. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning, model validation, and extensive evaluation steps are typically included in a comprehensive model training script for real applications.
