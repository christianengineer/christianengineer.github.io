Certainly! Below is an example file for training a machine learning model using mock data for the Community Solar Power Planning application. The file is named `train_model.py`, and it can be located within the `src/model_training/` directory of the project structure.

```python
## src/model_training/train_model.py

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
import joblib

## Load mock data (replace with actual data loading code)
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_mock_data.csv')

## Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering
## ...

## Split data into features and target variable
X = data.drop(columns=['target_variable'])
y = data['target_variable']

## Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

## Standardize the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

## Train a machine learning model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Evaluate the model on the test set (replace with actual evaluation code)
## ...

## Save the trained model and scaler for deployment
joblib.dump(model, 'models/energy_output_prediction/energy_output_prediction_model.pkl')
