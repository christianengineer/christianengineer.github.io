Sure, I can provide an example of a function that implements a complex machine learning algorithm for object detection using mock video data. In this example, we'll use the popular YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm and assume that we have a pre-trained YOLO model file available.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def perform_object_detection(video_file_path, yolo_model_path):
    # Load YOLO model and configuration
    net = cv2.dnn.readNet(yolo_model_path, "yolov3.cfg")
    layers_names = net.getLayerNames()
    output_layers = [layers_names[i[0] - 1] for i in net.getUnconnectedOutLayers()]

    # Load mock video data
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_file_path)

    while cap.isOpened():
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break

        height, width, channels = frame.shape

        # Perform object detection
        blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(frame, 0.00392, (416, 416), (0, 0, 0), True, crop=False)
        net.setInput(blob)
        outs = net.forward(output_layers)

        # Post-processing of detected objects
        class_ids = []
        confidences = []
        boxes = []
        for out in outs:
            for detection in out:
                scores = detection[5:]
                class_id = np.argmax(scores)
                confidence = scores[class_id]
                if confidence > 0.5:
                    # Object detected
                    center_x = int(detection[0] * width)
                    center_y = int(detection[1] * height)
                    w = int(detection[2] * width)
                    h = int(detection[3] * height)

                    # Rectangle coordinates
                    x = int(center_x - w / 2)
                    y = int(center_y - h / 2)

                    boxes.append([x, y, w, h])
                    confidences.append(float(confidence))
                    class_ids.append(class_id)

        # Apply Non-maximum suppression to eliminate redundant overlapping boxes
        indexes = cv2.dnn.NMSBoxes(boxes, confidences, 0.5, 0.4)

        for i in range(len(boxes)):
            if i in indexes:
                x, y, w, h = boxes[i]
                label = str(class_ids[i])
                confidence = confidences[i]
                # Draw bounding box and label on the frame
                cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2)
                cv2.putText(frame, label, (x, y - 5), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.5, (0, 255, 0), 2)

        # Display the frame with detected objects
        cv2.imshow('Object Detection', frame)
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break

    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

In this example, the `perform_object_detection` function takes the file path to a mock video file and the file path to the pre-trained YOLO model as input. The function reads the video frames, performs object detection using the YOLO model, and displays the video frames with the detected objects using OpenCV. If you don't have OpenCV and YOLO installed, make sure to install them using libraries such as `pip install opencv-python` and `pip install opencv-python-headless`. Note that this function is simplified and doesn't handle error cases or edge conditions for brevity.

This function utilizes mock video data to simulate the object detection process for the WatchOver AI for Video Surveillance application. The algorithm can be further integrated into the application codebase for real-time or batch processing of surveillance video data to detect and track objects, enhancing the security and safety capabilities of the application.

Sure, I can provide an example of a function that implements a complex deep learning algorithm for video classification using mock video data. In this example, we'll use a convolutional neural network (CNN) for action recognition and assume that we have a pre-trained CNN model available.

```python
import torch
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

def perform_action_recognition(video_file_path, cnn_model_path):
    # Load the pre-trained CNN model
    cnn_model = torch.load(cnn_model_path)
    cnn_model.eval()  # Set the model to evaluation mode

    # Define the transformations to be applied to each frame of the video
    transform = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    ])

    # Load and process mock video data
    video_frames = load_video_frames(video_file_path)
    video_tensor = torch.stack([transform(frame) for frame in video_frames])

    # Perform action recognition on the video tensor
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = cnn_model(video_tensor)

    # Post-processing of the classification outputs
    probabilities = torch.nn.functional.softmax(outputs, dim=1)
    predicted_classes = torch.argmax(probabilities, dim=1)

    # Return the predicted classes as a list of action labels
    action_labels = [get_action_label(class_id.item()) for class_id in predicted_classes]
    return action_labels

def load_video_frames(video_file_path):
    # Mock function to load and process video frames as a list of numpy arrays
    # This function is for demonstration purposes and should be replaced with actual video data loading and processing logic
    video_frames = []  # Placeholder for processed video frames
    # ... Logic to load and process video frames from the specified file path
    return video_frames

def get_action_label(class_id):
    # Mock function to retrieve action labels based on class IDs
    # Replace with actual action labels corresponding to the model's classes
    action_labels = ["walking", "running", "standing", "sitting", "sneezing", "typing", "reading", "eating"]
    return action_labels[class_id]

# Example usage
video_file_path = "path/to/mock/video.mp4"
cnn_model_path = "path/to/pretrained/cnn_model.pth"
predicted_actions = perform_action_recognition(video_file_path, cnn_model_path)
print(predicted_actions)
```

In this example, the `perform_action_recognition` function takes the file path to a mock video file and the file path to the pre-trained CNN model as input. The function processes the video frames using the pre-defined transformation, feeds the processed frames to the CNN model, and returns the predicted action labels for each frame. Note that this example assumes the availability of a pre-trained model file in PyTorch's `.pth` format.

The `load_video_frames` function is a mock function that simulates the loading and processing of video frames from the specified file path, but in a real-world scenario, this function would be responsible for actual video data loading and transformation.

The `get_action_label` function is a mock function that maps class IDs to action labels based on the model's classes. In a production environment, this function should be replaced with the actual action labels corresponding to the model's classes.

This function demonstrates the integration of a complex deep learning algorithm for action recognition into the WatchOver AI for Video Surveillance application, using mock video data. It showcases the application of deep learning for analyzing and classifying activities within surveillance video streams, enhancing the application's video monitoring and analysis capabilities.
