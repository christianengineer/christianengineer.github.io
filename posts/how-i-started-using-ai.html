    <h1>How I started using AI as a Software Engineer</h1>
    <p>
      It was mid summer when our team had already release features to
      production. We were a greenfield project. In the beginning.
    </p>
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Our features needed to be measured. We were releasing features that made a
      lot of api calls, and we didn't know how many resources we were using.
    </p>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
      Our manager decided for me to start diving into the deployment of our
      applications. I needed take the spot of our team's devops expert as we
      didn't have a dedicated person for these type of tasks. Deployment tasks.
      The only person who was managing our deployment pipeline was our
      organization's Principal Engineer, who was overlooking many other team's
      processes than ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      I realized that this was not just a task for me that I needed to complete.
      It was crutial for our team. My team needs my help.
    </p>
    <h2>Struggle 1</h2>
    <p>
      My planning took a common approach. Take courses related to all the
      technologies I needed to learn as soon as possible. Jenkins, Docker,
      Kubernetes, and Azure/Google Cloud configurations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timeline for each course, and also certificates to validate my competency,
      was 3-6 months. This was not the time I wanted to spend to be able to
      contribute, better yet, help my team.
    </p>
    <h2>Struggle 2</h2>
    <p>
      I figured if I just spent more time outside of work hours to dive into
      these courses and complete these certificates, I can accelerate my
      learnings and comprehension of Devops. This process went for 2 weeks. The
      progress I was seeing was slow. I identified it as slow because of how
      quickly we were deploying features to production and I needed to help make
      our features optimized, fast. Now.
    </p>
    <h2>Struggle 3</h2>
    <p>
      More time spent outside of work ours. Replaced favorite music with DevOps
      podcasts. Replaced gym time with reading. Replaced traveling with
      scheduling certification exams
    </p>
    <h2>Reflection moment</h2>
    <p>
      It was an afternoon of tiredness, knowing that reading and consuming
      information was slow. Knowing that I just needed to read topics just
      because a certification required me to know about it. Knowing that some
      information I was trying to memorize was not relevant to what my team
      needed now.
    </p>
    <h2>Enlighting moment</h2>
    <p>I decided to give ChatGPT a try—July 2023—, my first question was:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>What is DevOps?</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The answer I received was an answer I always see at the top of Google
      Search results.
    </p>
    <p>This was the moment where I decided to ask it, why?</p>
    <p>The answer I recieved was a bit different than I expected.</p>
    <p>
      I was used to getting this type of answer to my "why?" by reading other
      engineering blog posts and articles. It was an answer that I had to
      formulate from a summary of all the research I would have done if I wanted
      to know why.
    </p>
    <h2>Time saving moment</h2>
    <p>
      This is when I realized I have probably saved about 2 - 3 hours of
      research on why DevOps is needed.
    </p>
    <p>My curious mindset kicked in. So I asked:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>Give me examples</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It gave me examples catered to personal small projects. At this point, you
      might have guess what I asked next:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>Give me examples at large companies</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The rest is history</h2>
    <p>I dove into topics of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code
          >What is a node in Kubernetes. Do not give me a definition, give me a
          list of all physical hardware parts that make node.</code
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <code
          >What file extension is used when a docker container is pulled from a
          container registry by Kubernetes.</code
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <code
          >List all the Kubernetes clusters, container registries a large
          company would have with 1000 applications and 5000 software engineers.
          Generate a fictitious company.</code
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Mission Accomplished</h2>
    <p>
      I accelerated my learning of DevOps by using AI. I saved my company hours,
      days and weeks of training. I saved myself hours, days and weeks of
      learning. I saved my team.
    </p>
    <p>
      And best of all, I learned that I can apply this same method of curisoty
      with any topic I've always been interested in learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's start with topics that require a Bachelor's or even a Master's
      degree.
