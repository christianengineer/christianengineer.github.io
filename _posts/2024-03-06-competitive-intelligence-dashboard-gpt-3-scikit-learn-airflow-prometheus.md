To generate a large fictitious dataset that reflects real-world data relevant to the Competitive Intelligence Dashboard project for Supermercados Peruanos, including attributes from the features needed for the project, I will provide a Python script that utilizes the `numpy` library for dataset generation and the `pandas` library for data manipulation. Additionally, we will include data validation techniques to ensure data quality and variability for effective model training and validation.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

## Generate fictitious competitor data
n_rows = 10000

## Competitor pricing attributes
price_avg = np.random.uniform(1, 100, n_rows)
price_diff = np.random.normal(5, 2, n_rows)

## Competitor promotion attributes
promotion_freq = np.random.randint(0, 10, n_rows)
promotion_type = np.random.choice(['Discount', 'BOGO', 'Free Gift'], n_rows)

## Competitor product attributes
product_category = np.random.choice(['Grocery', 'Electronics', 'Clothing'], n_rows)
product_rating = np.random.uniform(1, 5, n_rows)

## Customer data attributes
customer_id = np.arange(1, n_rows + 1)
customer_age = np.random.randint(18, 65, n_rows)
customer_gender = np.random.choice(['Male', 'Female'], n_rows)
purchase_freq = np.random.poisson(5, n_rows)
purchase_amount = np.random.normal(50, 10, n_rows)

## Create fictitious dataset
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'price_avg': price_avg,
    'price_diff': price_diff,
    'promotion_freq': promotion_freq,
    'promotion_type': promotion_type,
    'product_category': product_category,
    'product_rating': product_rating,
    'customer_id': customer_id,
    'customer_age': customer_age,
    'customer_gender': customer_gender,
    'purchase_freq': purchase_freq,
    'purchase_amount': purchase_amount
})

## Perform data validation
## Check for missing values
missing_values = data.isnull().sum()
print("Missing Values:\n", missing_values)

## Add noise to simulated data
data['price_avg'] += np.random.normal(0, 5, n_rows)
data['purchase_amount'] += np.random.normal(0, 5, n_rows)

## Save fictitious dataset to CSV
data.to_csv("fictitious_competitor_customer_data.csv", index=False)
```

In the script:
