## Infrastructure for Air Quality Forecasting using TensorFlow

Building an infrastructure to support the Air Quality Forecasting application involves considerations for data processing, model training and serving, scalability, and real-time inference capabilities.

## Data Processing and Storage
For handling environmental data, the infrastructure can utilize robust data processing and storage components:
1. **Data Ingestion**: Implement a data ingestion pipeline to collect and ingest real-time environmental data from various sources such as IoT devices, weather stations, and government databases.
2. **Data Storage**: Store the historical and real-time environmental data in a scalable and reliable data storage system, such as a data lake or a distributed file system, to accommodate large volumes of data.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Deploy scalable data preprocessing pipelines using tools like Apache Spark or cloud-based data processing services to clean, normalize, and preprocess the environmental data before model training.

## Model Training and Serving
The infrastructure should support the training and serving of machine learning models for air quality forecasting:
1. **Model Training**: Utilize distributed computing frameworks like TensorFlow distributed training, Apache Hadoop, or Apache Flink to train machine learning models at scale using historical environmental data.
2. **Model Serving**: Deploy the trained models on a scalable and high-performance serving infrastructure, such as Kubernetes or serverless computing platforms, to handle real-time or near-real-time inference requests from users or applications.

## Scalability and Availability
Considering the need for scalability and availability, the infrastructure should incorporate the following:
1. **Cloud Services**: Leverage cloud computing services for scalability, elasticity, and cost-effectiveness. This may include using managed services for data processing, storage, and model serving from cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure.
2. **Auto-Scaling**: Implement auto-scaling mechanisms to automatically adjust computing resources based on demand, ensuring the application can handle varying workloads without manual intervention.
3. **Load Balancing**: Introduce load balancers to distribute incoming prediction requests across multiple instances of the serving infrastructure, improving performance and handling spikes in traffic.

## Real-time Inference
To support real-time inference, the infrastructure can include:
1. **Streaming Data Processing**: Incorporate streaming data processing frameworks like Apache Kafka or Apache Flink to handle real-time ingestion, processing, and forwarding of environmental data for immediate predictions.
2. **API Gateway**: Integrate an API gateway to expose a RESTful or GraphQL API for users and applications to submit real-time air quality prediction requests to the serving infrastructure.

By designing and implementing a robust infrastructure encompassing these components, the Air Quality Forecasting application can effectively support the processing, training, serving, and real-time inference of machine learning models for accurate and scalable air quality predictions.

In the above Python code, a function `complex_lstm_model` is defined to create a complex LSTM model for air quality forecasting using TensorFlow. The function takes the input shape as a parameter and returns the constructed LSTM model. 
Additionally, mock data is generated to simulate the model training process. The model is then compiled and trained with the mock data. Finally, the trained model is saved to a specified file path using the `save` method.

Please replace `'path/to/save/model/model_name.h5'` with the actual file path where you want to save the trained model.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, LSTM
import numpy as np

def train_and_save_air_quality_model(input_data, output_data, file_path):

    file_path (str): File path to save the trained model.

    Returns:
    Trained model saved at the specified file path.

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(input_data, output_data, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

    ## Save the trained model

In this code, the `train_and_save_air_quality_model` function takes input data, output data, and a file path as parameters. It creates a complex LSTM model for air quality forecasting, compiles the model, trains it with the provided mock data, and then saves the trained model to the specified file path.

To use this function, you can call it with the mock data and a file path for saving the trained model:

```python
## Create mock input and output data
num_samples = 1000
timesteps = 24
num_features = 5
