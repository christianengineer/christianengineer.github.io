## Objectives

The AI QualityCheck repository aims to provide a scalable and efficient solution for quality control using artificial intelligence. The primary objectives of this project include:

- Developing machine learning and deep learning models for image and video analysis to detect defects or anomalies in products.
- Implementing a scalable architecture to handle a large volume of data and real-time processing for quality control.
- Integrating AI models with existing quality control processes to automate and improve the accuracy of defect detection.

## System Design Strategies

To achieve the objectives, the following system design strategies are recommended:

- **Scalable Architecture:** Utilize a microservices-based architecture deployed on cloud infrastructure to scale resources based on demand.
- **Real-time Data Processing:** Implement a data streaming and processing system to handle real-time quality control analysis.
- **Model Serving and Inference:** Use a model serving framework to deploy and serve machine learning and deep learning models for inference.
- **Integration with Existing Systems:** Provide APIs and integration points to seamlessly integrate AI quality control with existing manufacturing processes.

## Chosen Libraries and Frameworks

The following libraries and frameworks are suggested for building the AI QualityCheck repository:

- **Machine Learning and Deep Learning:** TensorFlow or PyTorch for developing and training image and video analysis models.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def complex_machine_learning_algorithm(data_file_path):
    ## Load mock data from file
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Preprocessing mock data
    X = data.drop('label', axis=1)
    y = data['label']
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Initialize and train a Random Forest Classifier
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    ## Make predictions
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)

    ## Evaluate the model
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)

    return model, accuracy
```

In this example, the `complex_machine_learning_algorithm` function represents a hypothetical machine learning algorithm within the QualityCheck - AI for Quality Control application. The function takes a file path as input, which specifies the location of the mock data to be used for training and evaluation.

Here's a brief overview of the function's key steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The function loads the mock data from the specified file using pandas, preprocesses the data by separating features and labels, and splits it into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Training**: It initializes and trains a Random Forest Classifier using the training data.
3. **Model Evaluation**: After making predictions on the testing data, the function calculates the accuracy of the model.

The function returns both the trained model and the accuracy score, providing valuable insights into the performance of the machine learning algorithm.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def complex_deep_learning_algorithm(data_file_path):
    ## Load mock data from file
    data = pd.read_csv(data_file_path)

    ## Preprocessing mock data
    X = data.drop('label', axis=1).values
    y = data['label'].values
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    ## Standardize the data
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

    ## Build the deep learning model
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])

    model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='binary_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])

    ## Train the model
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

    ## Evaluate the model
    test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)

    return model, test_accuracy
```

In this example, the `complex_deep_learning_algorithm` function represents a hypothetical deep learning algorithm within the QualityCheck - AI for Quality Control application. Similar to the previous machine learning example, the function takes a file path as input, indicating the location of the mock data to be used for training and evaluation.

Here's a summary of the function's core steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The function loads the mock data from the specified file using pandas, preprocesses the data by separating features and labels, and splits it into training and testing sets. It also standardizes the input features using sklearn's StandardScaler.
2. **Model Construction**: It builds a sequential deep learning model using TensorFlow's Keras API, consisting of densely connected layers with ReLU activation and a final sigmoid activation layer.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: The function then compiles and trains the model using the training data and evaluates its performance on the testing data.

The function returns both the trained deep learning model and the accuracy score, providing crucial insights into the performance of the deep learning algorithm.
