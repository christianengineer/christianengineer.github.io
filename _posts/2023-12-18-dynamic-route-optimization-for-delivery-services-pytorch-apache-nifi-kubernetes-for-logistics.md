    def forward(self, x):
        out = self.fc1(x)
        out = self.relu(out)
        out = self.fc2(out)
        return out
```

2. **train.py**: This file contains the script for training the PyTorch model using the provided data. It loads the dataset, initializes the model, defines the loss function and optimizer, and runs the training loop. Below is a hypothetical example of the training script structure in train.py:

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(train_data)
    loss = criterion(outputs, train_labels)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Save the trained model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'route_optimization_model.pth')
```

3. **predict.py**: This file contains the script for using the trained model to make predictions on new data points. It loads the saved model, processes the input data, and generates predictions. Below is a hypothetical example of the prediction script structure in predict.py:

```python

    prediction = model(input_tensor)
    
# Process the prediction results
# ...
```

These files, within the `models/pytorch/` directory, form the core of the machine learning model implementation using PyTorch for the Dynamic Route Optimization for Delivery Services. They enable the training, inference, and utilization of the model within the logistics application.

The `kubernetes/` directory for the Dynamic Route Optimization for Delivery Services will contain the Kubernetes deployment and service configurations for orchestrating and scaling the application. It will consist of the following files:

```plaintext
kubernetes/
├─ deployment.yaml
├─ service.yaml
```

Here's an expansion of each file:

1. **deployment.yaml**: This file defines the Kubernetes deployment configuration for the Dynamic Route Optimization application. It specifies the container image, resource limits, environment variables, and other settings for running the application as a deployment. Below is a hypothetical example of the deployment configuration in deployment.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: dynamic-route-optimization
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: dynamic-route-optimization
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: dynamic-route-optimization
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: dynamic-route-optimization
        image: your-dynamic-route-optimization-image:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: "2Gi"
            cpu: "500m"
        env:
          - name: ENVIRONMENT
            value: "production"
          # Additional environment variables
```

2. **service.yaml**: This file defines the Kubernetes service configuration for the Dynamic Route Optimization application. It exposes the deployment as a service within the Kubernetes cluster, allowing other components to access it. Below is a hypothetical example of the service configuration in service.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: dynamic-route-optimization-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: dynamic-route-optimization
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer
```

These files, within the `kubernetes/` directory, enable the deployment and exposure of the Dynamic Route Optimization application as a scalable and accessible service within a Kubernetes cluster. The deployment.yaml file specifies how the application should be run and scaled, while the service.yaml file exposes the application to other services within the cluster or external users.

Certainly! Below is an example of a file for training a PyTorch model for the Dynamic Route Optimization using mock data. Let's call this file `train_model.py`. Please note that this is a simplified example for illustrative purposes and may not reflect a complete implementation.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np
from model import RouteOptimizationModel  # Assuming the model implementation is in model.py
from data_loader import MockDataLoader  # Assuming the data loading functionality is in data_loader.py

# Load mock training data
data_loader = MockDataLoader()
train_data, train_labels = data_loader.load_train_data()  # Assuming a method to load mock training data

# Initialize the model
input_size = len(train_data[0])
hidden_size = 64
output_size = len(train_labels[0])
model = RouteOptimizationModel(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)  # Assuming the model architecture is defined

# Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop
num_epochs = 10
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(torch.tensor(train_data).float())
    loss = criterion(outputs, torch.tensor(train_labels).float())
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Save the trained model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'trained_route_optimization_model.pth')
```

In this example:
- The training script `train_model.py` loads mock training data using a `MockDataLoader`.
- It initializes the PyTorch model, defines the loss function (MSE) and optimizer (Adam), and runs a simple training loop for a fixed number of epochs.
- After training, the script saves the trained model's state dictionary to a file named `trained_route_optimization_model.pth`.

File Path: `dynamic_route_optimization/models/pytorch/train_model.py`

This script serves as an example of how a PyTorch model for Dynamic Route Optimization could be trained using mock data within the logistics application.

Certainly! Below is an example of a file for a complex machine learning algorithm for the Dynamic Route Optimization using PyTorch and mock data. Let's call this file `complex_model_training.py`. Please note that this is a simplified example for illustrative purposes and may not reflect a complete implementation.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np
from model import ComplexRouteOptimizationModel  # Assuming the model implementation is in model.py
from data_loader import MockDataLoader  # Assuming the data loading functionality is in data_loader.py
from data_preprocessing import preprocess_data  # Assuming data preprocessing functionality

# Load and preprocess mock training data
data_loader = MockDataLoader()
raw_data = data_loader.load_raw_data()  # Assuming loading of raw mock data
preprocessed_data = preprocess_data(raw_data)  # Assuming data preprocessing method

# Split preprocessed data into features and labels
train_data, train_labels = preprocess_features_labels(preprocessed_data)  # Assuming data splitting and preprocessing method

# Initialize and configure the complex model
input_size = len(train_data[0])
hidden_size = 128
output_size = len(train_labels[0])
complex_model = ComplexRouteOptimizationModel(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)  # Assuming the complex model architecture is defined

# Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(complex_model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop
num_epochs = 20
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = complex_model(torch.tensor(train_data).float())
    loss = criterion(outputs, torch.tensor(train_labels).float())
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Save the trained model
torch.save(complex_model.state_dict(), 'trained_complex_route_optimization_model.pth')
```

In this example:
- The training script `complex_model_training.py` loads mock raw data using a `MockDataLoader`, preprocesses the data, and splits it into features and labels.
- It initializes a complex PyTorch model, defines the loss function (MSE) and optimizer (Adam), and runs a training loop for a fixed number of epochs.
- After training, the script saves the state dictionary of the trained complex model to a file named `trained_complex_route_optimization_model.pth`.

File Path: `dynamic_route_optimization/models/pytorch/complex_model_training.py`
